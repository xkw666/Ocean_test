        "context": "there are relatively few data on the change to reef-top habitats. surveys of reef island planiform change in the tropical western pacific and indian oceans have shown a remarkable degree of stability under rates of rslr up to the contemporary gmsl rate37,38. our collation of existing data on reef island morphometric changes (n = 872) from the indian and pacific oceans shows a higher probability of island contraction at rates of rslr above the rate of contemporary gmsl rise (methods; extended data fig. 3c). island size reduction is likely (p \u2265 0.66) at rslr above 6.2 mm yr\u22121. the rate of rslr in the solomon islands has averaged between 7 and 10 mm yr\u22121 since 1994 (ref. 39), and in the exposed northern isabel province, five of the twenty vegetated reef islands have completely eroded, leaving dead mangrove trunks on hard coral40. a further six islands contracted by more than 20% in the\nprojected response to future sea-level rise modelling of spatial variability in rslr was completed in the ipcc ar6 for each warming scenario42. we compared regional rslr projections to 2080\u20132100 with the distribution of mangroves, tidal marshes and coral reefs across the globe (fig. 3; methods). for each of the modelled scenarios, we determined the proportion of mangrove, tidal marsh and coral reef island habitat occurring where rslr is projected to rise to levels for which eventual retreat of mangroves and tidal marshes is likely (4 mm yr\u22121) or very likely (7 mm yr\u22121), the best estimate from our combined palaeo and instrumental observations. for reef islands (a subset of mapped reefs), contraction or increasing island instability by rslr of 7 mm yr\u22121 is likely (extended data fig. 2c), although we cannot yet specify a rate of rslr at which contraction is highly likely, given the scarcity of contemporary observations at higher rates of rslr, and because this threshold will vary with the rate of surrounding reef vertical growth, reef flat width, wave exposure, island size and height, and reef-derived sediment supply.\nin the 1.5 \u00b0c scenario, the likely (p \u2265 0.66) rate of gmsl rise at 2080\u2013 2100 is between 2.4 and 6.4 mm yr\u22121. coastlines subject to rates of rslr of 4 to 7 mm yr\u22121 correspond to centres of contemporary mangrove development, notably southeast asia and the caribbean. under this rate of rslr, elevation deficits are likely (p = 0.66\u20130.90; fig. 2). the probability of reaching a rate of rslr at which elevation deficits are very likely (7 mm yr\u22121) remains low (<11%), although coastlines subject to high rates of land subsidence\u2014including, for example, the us gulf coast and southeast asian deltas28,43\u2014are projected to exceed this rate. median projections for the 2 \u00b0c warming scenario suggest that one third of global mangroves are subject to \u22657 mm yr\u22121 and nearly all exposed to \u22654 mm yr\u22121 of rslr, although there is comparatively little change in the proportion of tidal marshes and reefs exposed to \u22657 mm yr\u22121 of rslr (table 1). under 3 \u00b0c of warming, nearly all tropical and subtropical latitude coastlines are exposed to \u22657 mm yr\u22121 of rslr, and these are the locations of most of the world\u2019s mangroves and coral reefs. median rslr projections along the world\u2019s coastlines therefore show the probability of elevation deficits in mangroves shifting from likely to very likely between 2 \u00b0c and 3 \u00b0c of global warming (fig. 3 and table 1).\nfor mangroves and tidal marshes, loss is the proportion of existing area exposed to 4 mm yr\u22121 (likely loss; p > 0.66) and 7 mm yr\u22121 (very likely loss; p > 0.9) of rslr based on probability distributions presented in fig. 2, and the rslr modelling in fig. 3. for coral reef islands, the proportion refers to numbers of reefs, and uses the conservative estimate of likely vulnerability to rslr at 7 mm yr\u20131 (the full dataset with uncertainties is presented as extended data table 1).\nthe contemporary distribution and extent of mangroves83 (https://doi. org/10.34892/07vk-ws51), tidal marshes84 (https://doi.org/10.34892/ w2ew-m835) and coral reefs85 (figs. 1, 3 and 4) was accessed from the ocean data viewer (https://data.unep-wcmc.org), hosted by the un environment world conservation monitoring centre. an important caveat in relation to the representation of tidal marshes is the poor coverage of their possible extent at high northern latitudes. for fig. 3, the coral reef dataset was complemented by additional data on the global distribution of atolls, which was sourced from the world atolls database86 (https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=1c18adf04 d9e47669281061ff60167e1).\nwe summarized the probability thresholds at which marsh or mangrove elevation deficit becomes likely (p \u2265 0.66) or very likely (p \u2265 0.90), adopting ipcc likelihood language91. to estimate the probability of a negative tendency (fig. 2b,c) or elevation deficit (fig. 2e,f) conditional on rates of rslr, we follow ref. 15 by modelling the elevation budget or facies successions as binary response variables (elevation deficit or drowning, 1; elevation surplus or terrestrial, 0) in a bayesian framework. we chose the bin widths for histograms and the number of segments in the bayesian analysis by visual inspection for best fit. details of the probabilistic analysis used to estimate the relationship between mangrove initiation and rslr rates (fig. 3f) can be found in ref. 4.\necosystem exposure to projected rslr for fig. 3, available polygons for tidal marshes, mangroves and coral reefs were converted to point files based on each polygon\u2019s centroid coordinates. where polygon features consisted of multiple polygons, polygon features were split into single-polygon features before converting them to centroid points. all resulting polygon centroids were merged with the available point data for mangroves, tidal marshes and reef islands into a dataset containing 1,885,466 entries. to visualize the spatial variability of wetland exposure to local sea-level rise (fig. 3a\u2013d), local rslr rates (incorporating vertical land movement)42 were extracted from the median projections of the temperature-limited scenarios 1.5 \u00b0c, 2.0 \u00b0c, 3.0 \u00b0c and 4.0 \u00b0c and classified into the following rslr rate exposure categories: <0 mm yr\u22121 (blue), 0\u20134 mm yr\u22121 (yellow), 4\u20137 mm yr\u22121 (orange) and >7 mm yr\u22121 (red).\nto calculate proportional changes of exposure to local rslr rates for all five temperature-limited scenarios (fig. 3e\u2013g), only the available polygons for salt marshes, mangroves and coral reefs were utilized, as those included accurate aerial information. as above, polygon data were converted to point files, based on their centroid locations, but to preserve the accurate aerial information multi-polygon features were not split up. all local rslr rates of each scenario (five temperature scenarios, with three percentiles each) were extracted for each ecosystem category to calculate proportional exposure to rslr rates <0 mm yr\u22121, 0\u20134 mm yr\u22121, 4\u20137 mm yr\u22121 and >7 mm yr\u22121. for each temperature scenario, the respective uncertainty range was defined by the lower (17%) and upper (83%) percentiles respectively.",

        "context": "in addition, examples shown in fig. 5 contain a simple thermodynamic term to mimic the effect of modal peak shift of thickness distribution due to thermodynamic ice growth:\nthe initial condition of the ice thickness distribution in fig. 5 is given by a thermodynamically grown sea ice without dynamic deformation, x0. this is also a stochastic variable, having a normal distribution for simplicity:\nwhere \u03bc0 = 1.0 and \u03c30 = 0.25 are applied in the examples (that is, 1 m mean ice thickness with 0.25 s.d., shown by m = 0 in fig. 5), which roughly corresponds to the thickness of new ice three months after its formation (based on anderson\u2019s freezing degree days law25, with an assumption of ts = 253 k). figure 5 shows examples of ice thickness distribution after 60, 120 and 180 dynamic events, roughly corresponding to 1.5, 3 and 4.5 years of residence time of sea ice.\nthe current formulation contains three parameters to describe the dynamic ice thickening process: b (the proportionate thickening constant); \u03b1 (the areal probability of dynamic thickening); and m (the number of dynamic events). in this study, we briefly describe the sensitivity of the ice thickness distributions to these parameters. in general, a smaller (larger) thickening constant b decelerates (accelerates) the dynamic thickening process, that is, a smaller b gives a smaller variance and steeper modal peak of thickness distribution if \u03b1 and m are fixed. however, a large value of b (for example, b = 0.8, indicating that ridged ice can be 1.8 times thicker than the ice before an event at maximum) makes the distribution bimodal because the possible thickness gain at each dynamic event is far from the modal thickness and the ridged/rafted ice tends to generate another peak apart from the mode. therefore, the possible and realistic range of b should be examined further together with the probability density function of the thickening increment r by high-resolution observations in the future. the areal probability of dynamic thickening, \u03b1, also affects the evolution of the dynamic thickening process. a larger \u03b1 promotes dynamic thickening because a larger fraction of pack ice can be deformed at one event. the thickness dependency of the probability, equation (8), decelerates further thickening of thick ice. although values of b and \u03b1 affect the progress of dynamic thickening in the model, we obtained similar ice thickness distributions with a log-normal form sooner or later, that is, smaller b and \u03b1 can be compensated by a large m, the number of deformation events, indicating a robustness of the formulation. the resulting shape of the distribution, its temporal evolution (fig. 5) and its comparison with the observed change in distribution (fig. 1b) suggest that the proposed stochastic ice thickening model captures the essence of the dynamic thickening process that resulted in the observed changes in ice thickness distribution.",

        "context": "a large fraction of the arctic ocean\u2019s sea ice is formed in the marginal seas of the arctic ocean, from the alaskan to siberian sectors of the arctic9, that is, the beaufort, chukchi, east siberian and laptev seas. it is then transported across the arctic to sustain the perennial ice pack (fig. 1a). a main part of sea ice formed in the alaskan sector circulates in the canada basin10, while a part of the ice is pushed towards the siberian sector via the chukchi sea11. sea ice formed in the siberian sector, together with the ice from the alaskan sector, joins the tpd emanating from offshore of the siberian shelves. the tpd transports the ice to the central arctic and further towards the atlantic sector of the arctic8,12. finally, it exits the arctic ocean through the fram strait, located between north-eastern greenland and svalbard. sea ice motion and ice age estimates from observations indicate an acceleration of ice motion and hence decrease of residence time of sea ice in the arctic basin in recent decades13,14.\nbecause up to approximately 90% of sea ice outflow from the arctic ocean to the subarctic north atlantic occurs through the fram strait15,16, sea ice properties observed in the fram strait represent basin-wide characteristics of arctic sea ice14,17. the fram strait arctic outflow observatory has been monitoring sea ice and ocean properties in the core of the outflow at a latitude of approximately 79\u00b0 n18 (marked red in fig. 1a)\nsea ice observed in the fram strait consists of a variety of ice types and thicknesses, reflecting its thermal and dynamic history before exiting the arctic basin20,21. typically, ice thickness distribution in the fram strait is bimodal (fig. 1b and extended data fig. 5). the first peak represents thin sea ice (less than 0.5 m) formed in the vicinity of the fram strait, while the second peak (that is, the modal peak), which has a 1.5\u20133 m thickness, primarily represents thermodynamically grown sea ice that has been transported across the arctic basin. finally, the distribution has a long tail towards thicker ice fractions, corresponding to dynamically thickened sea ice (from thinner thermodynamically grown sea ice) due to ridging and rafting. the second peak and tail can be reasonably well approximated using a log-normal function (fig. 1b, extended data fig. 5 and methods). this part of the distribution represents sea ice properties in the central arctic and gives information on combined thermal and dynamic forcing on sea ice from the time of its formation to its arrival in the fram strait.\nand consequent reduction of mean ice thickness in the arctic ocean21. in the fram strait, the thickness of the modal peak has been reduced by approximately 1 m (2.7 m to 1.7 m; fig. 1b, dashed lines); a fraction of the ice in the mode (height of the peak) has increased by 67% from 1990\u20132006 to 2007\u20132019 (fig. 1b, blue versus orange line). the tail of the distribution, corresponding to the deformed fraction of ice, has also substantially changed between the two periods: the thickness distribution for 1990\u20132006 (fig. 1b, blue line) was characterized by thicker modal thickness with a smaller and broader modal peak and a larger fraction of deformed ice (thick and deformed ice regime), while the period after 2007 (fig. 1b, orange line) is characterized by a thinner modal thickness with more compact distribution of ice thickness around the mode and a smaller fraction of deformed ice (thin and more uniform ice regime). these findings from the mooring observations are consistent with in situ observations22.\nfigure 2a shows the time series of ice thickness distribution in the fram strait for the last three decades. darker shading indicates a larger fraction of sea ice at the corresponding thickness. a zonal band with a darker shade ranging approximately from 3.0 m to 1.5 m, depicts the modal thickness of multi-year sea ice. the temporal variation of this band describes the long-term changes of modal sea ice thickness in the central arctic. the time series clearly shows that the change of the thickness distribution (fig. 1b) has not been a gradual process but that a distinct shift from thick and deformed ice regime to thinner and more uniform ice regime occurred around 2007 (visualized by the intensity of the shade at the modal peak in fig. 2a). the shift is further evidenced by coincident changes in modal peak height (fig. 2b) and the variance of ice thickness distribution (fig. 2c). the modal peak height and variance were obtained from a fitted log-normal function to each distribution (methods). the modal peak height gives a measure of compactness of the distribution around the mode, while the variance gives an indication of deformed fraction of sea ice relative to the modal peak. the sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts23 we applied to these time series detected a shift in both peak height and variance in 2007 (extended data fig. 6 and extended data table 1). this indicates that until 2007, ice floes consisted of sea ice with a variety of thicknesses towards thicker ice, whereas from 2007, they have consisted of ice of more uniform thickness with a smaller deformed fraction. this is also clearly visible in shifts with a 1-year delay in the fraction of thick ice (that is, ice thickness exceeding 4 and 5 m) shown in fig. 2d. this fraction corresponds to ice thicker than the maximum theoretical thickness of thermodynamically grown ice derived by different sea ice models24,25, that is, giving a measure of the fraction of dynamically deformed ice. the shift of ice thickness distribution in 2007 and 2008 indicates that a sudden reduction of dynamic forcing on the ice occurred at that time.\nfigure 5 shows examples of the probability density function of xm for different m (methods). the plot demonstrates that the shorter residence (smaller m) gives higher modal peak and less deformed sea ice. the simple proportionate thickening process conceptually explains (1) the shape of the observed ice thickness distribution (the log-normal shapes in fig. 1b) and, more importantly, (2) the reduction of the fraction of deformed ice for the shorter residence time after 2007 (fig. 2).\nour analysis demonstrates the long-lasting impact of climate change on arctic sea ice through reduced residence time, suggesting an irreversible response of arctic sea ice thickness connected to an increase of ocean heat content in areas of ice formation. the large reduction of summer ice extent in the alaskan and siberian sectors in 2005 and 2007 triggered intensive ice\u2013albedo feedback42,45 and initiated the perennial increase of ocean heat content in these areas44. this resulted in the stepwise reduction of residence time of sea ice in the siberian sector of the arctic, and hence a nonlinear response of the system. before the shift, sea ice formed in and offshore of the siberian shelves overwintered (spent about 15 months) in this area before entering the tpd (extended data fig. 2), during which the ice thickened and increased its deformed fraction. after the shift, ice stayed in this area only about 6 months on average (extended data fig. 2), resulting in recruitment of newly formed younger ice into the tpd and more sea ice formation during tpd transit to the fram strait26. the younger ice is thin, weakly linked and features ridges with more shallow keels; hence, it is more prone to wind forcing pushing the ice towards the atlantic sector of the arctic28,47. this process accelerated the tpd from 2007 onwards (fig. 4d), while enhanced wind forcing after 2007 may also have contributed to the acceleration of the tpd (extended data fig. 7). because of the shorter residence time, the part of the ice that has thermodynamically grown is thinner17 (reduction of modal thickness in fig. 1b) and the relative amount of the deformed fraction of ice has decreased (figs. 1b and 2).\nsea ice draft data were obtained from upward looking sonar (uls) moored in the east greenland current in the western fram strait. the dataset continuously covers the last three decades (1990\u20132019) with some short temporal gaps. four ulss were zonally aligned at approximately 79\u00b0 n from 3\u00b0 w to 6.5\u00b0 w (fig. 1a). the latitude of the mooring array changed from 79\u00b0 n to 78.8\u00b0 n in 2001. the zonal positions (names) of the moorings equipped with uls are 3\u00b0 w (f11), 4\u00b0 w (f12), 5\u00b0 w (f13) and 6.5\u00b0 w (f14), respectively. there are three main temporal data gaps during the three decades of measurements, that is, 1996, 2002 and 2008. except for these gaps, ulss were in operation although their number varied from time to time. the uls measures the travel time of the sound reflected at the bottom of the floating sea ice, from which we calculate the ice draft, the underwater fraction of sea ice54. the raw data were processed to ice draft using procedures described in earlier literature55,56. the accuracy of each draft measurement ranges from 0.1 m (ice profiling sonars (ips) deployed after 2006) to 0.2 m (es300 instruments before 2006), while the uncertainty of each individual measurement is not subject to bias errors and the summary error statistics of monthly values are less than 0.1 m57.\nthe current formulation contains three parameters to describe the dynamic ice thickening process: b (the proportionate thickening constant); \u03b1 (the areal probability of dynamic thickening); and m (the number of dynamic events). in this study, we briefly describe the sensitivity of the ice thickness distributions to these parameters. in general, a smaller (larger) thickening constant b decelerates (accelerates) the dynamic thickening process, that is, a smaller b gives a smaller variance and steeper modal peak of thickness distribution if \u03b1 and m are fixed. however, a large value of b (for example, b = 0.8, indicating that ridged ice can be 1.8 times thicker than the ice before an event at maximum) makes the distribution bimodal because the possible thickness gain at each dynamic event is far from the modal thickness and the ridged/rafted ice tends to generate another peak apart from the mode. therefore, the possible and realistic range of b should be examined further together with the probability density function of the thickening increment r by high-resolution observations in the future. the areal probability of dynamic thickening, \u03b1, also affects the evolution of the dynamic thickening process. a larger \u03b1 promotes dynamic thickening because a larger fraction of pack ice can be deformed at one event. the thickness dependency of the probability, equation (8), decelerates further thickening of thick ice. although values of b and \u03b1 affect the progress of dynamic thickening in the model, we obtained similar ice thickness distributions with a log-normal form sooner or later, that is, smaller b and \u03b1 can be compensated by a large m, the number of deformation events, indicating a robustness of the formulation. the resulting shape of the distribution, its temporal evolution (fig. 5) and its comparison with the observed change in distribution (fig. 1b) suggest that the proposed stochastic ice thickening model captures the essence of the dynamic thickening process that resulted in the observed changes in ice thickness distribution.",

fig. 1b, dashed lines); a fraction of the ice in the mode (height of the peak) has increased by 67% from 1990\u20132006 to 2007\u20132019 (fig. 1b, blue versus orange line). the tail of the distribution, corresponding to the deformed fraction of ice, has also substantially changed between the two periods: the thickness distribution for 1990\u20132006 (fig. 1b, blue line) was characterized by thicker modal thickness with a smaller and broader modal peak and a larger fraction of deformed ice (thick and deformed ice regime), while the period after 2007 (fig. 1b, orange line) is characterized by a thinner modal thickness with more compact distribution of ice thickness around the mode and a smaller fraction of deformed ice (thin and more uniform ice regime). these findings from the mooring observations are consistent with in situ observations22.\nfigure 2a shows the time series of ice thickness distribution in the fram strait for the last three decades. darker shading indicates a larger fraction of sea ice at the corresponding thickness. a zonal band with a darker shade ranging approximately from 3.0 m to 1.5 m, depicts the modal thickness of multi-year sea ice. the temporal variation of this band describes the long-term changes of modal sea ice thickness in the central arctic. the time series clearly shows that the change of the thickness distribution (fig. 1b) has not been a gradual process but that a distinct shift from thick and deformed ice regime to thinner and more uniform ice regime occurred around 2007 (visualized by the intensity of the shade at the modal peak in fig. 2a). the shift is further evidenced by coincident changes in modal peak height (fig. 2b) and the variance of ice thickness distribution (fig. 2c). the modal peak height and variance were obtained from a fitted log-normal function to each distribution (methods). the modal peak height gives a measure of compactness of the distribution around the mode, while the variance gives an indication of deformed fraction of sea ice relative to the modal peak. the sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts23 we applied to these time series detected a shift in both peak height and variance in 2007 (extended data fig. 6 and extended data table 1). this indicates that until 2007, ice floes consisted of sea ice with a variety of thicknesses towards thicker ice, whereas from 2007, they have consisted of ice of more uniform thickness with a smaller deformed fraction. this is also clearly visible in shifts with a 1-year delay in the fraction of thick ice (that is, ice thickness exceeding 4 and 5 m) shown in fig. 2d. this fraction corresponds to ice thicker than the maximum theoretical thickness of thermodynamically grown ice derived by different sea ice models24,25, that is, giving a measure of the fraction of dynamically deformed ice. the shift of ice thickness distribution in 2007 and 2008 indicates that a sudden reduction of dynamic forcing on the ice occurred at that time.\nfigure 5 shows examples of the probability density function of xm for different m (methods). the plot demonstrates that the shorter residence (smaller m) gives higher modal peak and less deformed sea ice. the simple proportionate thickening process conceptually explains (1) the shape of the observed ice thickness distribution (the log-normal shapes in fig. 1b) and, more importantly, (2) the reduction of the fraction of deformed ice for the shorter residence time after 2007 (fig. 2).\nour analysis demonstrates the long-lasting impact of climate change on arctic sea ice through reduced residence time, suggesting an irreversible response of arctic sea ice thickness connected to an increase of ocean heat content in areas of ice formation. the large reduction of summer ice extent in the alaskan and siberian sectors in 2005 and 2007 triggered intensive ice\u2013albedo feedback42,45 and initiated the perennial increase of ocean heat content in these areas44. this resulted in the stepwise reduction of residence time of sea ice in the siberian sector of the arctic, and hence a nonlinear response of the system. before the shift, sea ice formed in and offshore of the siberian shelves overwintered (spent about 15 months) in this area before entering the tpd (extended data fig. 2), during which the ice thickened and increased its deformed fraction. after the shift, ice stayed in this area only about 6 months on average (extended data fig. 2), resulting in recruitment of newly formed younger ice into the tpd and more sea ice formation during tpd transit to the fram strait26. the younger ice is thin, weakly linked and features ridges with more shallow keels; hence, it is more prone to wind forcing pushing the ice towards the atlantic sector of the arctic28,47. this process accelerated the tpd from 2007 onwards (fig. 4d), while enhanced wind forcing after 2007 may also have contributed to the acceleration of the tpd (extended data fig. 7). because of the shorter residence time, the part of the ice that has thermodynamically grown is thinner17 (reduction of modal thickness in fig. 1b) and the relative amount of the deformed fraction of ice has decreased (figs. 1b and 2).\nsea ice draft data were obtained from upward looking sonar (uls) moored in the east greenland current in the western fram strait. the dataset continuously covers the last three decades (1990\u20132019) with some short temporal gaps. four ulss were zonally aligned at approximately 79\u00b0 n from 3\u00b0 w to 6.5\u00b0 w (fig. 1a). the latitude of the mooring array changed from 79\u00b0 n to 78.8\u00b0 n in 2001. the zonal positions (names) of the moorings equipped with uls are 3\u00b0 w (f11), 4\u00b0 w (f12), 5\u00b0 w (f13) and 6.5\u00b0 w (f14), respectively. there are three main temporal data gaps during the three decades of measurements, that is, 1996, 2002 and 2008. except for these gaps, ulss were in operation although their number varied from time to time. the uls measures the travel time of the sound reflected at the bottom of the floating sea ice, from which we calculate the ice draft, the underwater fraction of sea ice54. the raw data were processed to ice draft using procedures described in earlier literature55,56. the accuracy of each draft measurement ranges from 0.1 m (ice profiling sonars (ips) deployed after 2006) to 0.2 m (es300 instruments before 2006), while the uncertainty of each individual measurement is not subject to bias errors and the summary error statistics of monthly values are less than 0.1 m57.\nthe current formulation contains three parameters to describe the dynamic ice thickening process: b (the proportionate thickening constant); \u03b1 (the areal probability of dynamic thickening); and m (the number of dynamic events). in this study, we briefly describe the sensitivity of the ice thickness distributions to these parameters. in general, a smaller (larger) thickening constant b decelerates (accelerates) the dynamic thickening process, that is, a smaller b gives a smaller variance and steeper modal peak of thickness distribution if \u03b1 and m are fixed. however, a large value of b (for example, b = 0.8, indicating that ridged ice can be 1.8 times thicker than the ice before an event at maximum) makes the distribution bimodal because the possible thickness gain at each dynamic event is far from the modal thickness and the ridged/rafted ice tends to generate another peak apart from the mode. therefore, the possible and realistic range of b should be examined further together with the probability density function of the thickening increment r by high-resolution observations in the future. the areal probability of dynamic thickening, \u03b1, also affects the evolution of the dynamic thickening process. a larger \u03b1 promotes dynamic thickening because a larger fraction of pack ice can be deformed at one event. the thickness dependency of the probability, equation (8), decelerates further thickening of thick ice. although values of b and \u03b1 affect the progress of dynamic thickening in the model, we obtained similar ice thickness distributions with a log-normal form sooner or later, that is, smaller b and \u03b1 can be compensated by a large m, the number of deformation events, indicating a robustness of the formulation. the resulting shape of the distribution, its temporal evolution (fig. 5) and its comparison with the observed change in distribution (fig. 1b) suggest that the proposed stochastic ice thickening model captures the essence of the dynamic thickening process that resulted in the observed changes in ice thickness distribution.",

hence, it is more prone to wind forcing pushing the ice towards the atlantic sector of the arctic28,47. this process accelerated the tpd from 2007 onwards (fig. 4d), while enhanced wind forcing after 2007 may also have contributed to the acceleration of the tpd (extended data fig. 7). because of the shorter residence time, the part of the ice that has thermodynamically grown is thinner17 (reduction of modal thickness in fig. 1b) and the relative amount of the deformed fraction of ice has decreased (figs. 1b and 2).\nsea ice draft data were obtained from upward looking sonar (uls) moored in the east greenland current in the western fram strait. the dataset continuously covers the last three decades (1990\u20132019) with some short temporal gaps. four ulss were zonally aligned at approximately 79\u00b0 n from 3\u00b0 w to 6.5\u00b0 w (fig. 1a). the latitude of the mooring array changed from 79\u00b0 n to 78.8\u00b0 n in 2001. the zonal positions (names) of the moorings equipped with uls are 3\u00b0 w (f11), 4\u00b0 w (f12), 5\u00b0 w (f13) and 6.5\u00b0 w (f14), respectively. there are three main temporal data gaps during the three decades of measurements, that is, 1996, 2002 and 2008. except for these gaps, ulss were in operation although their number varied from time to time. the uls measures the travel time of the sound reflected at the bottom of the floating sea ice, from which we calculate the ice draft, the underwater fraction of sea ice54. the raw data were processed to ice draft using procedures described in earlier literature55,56. the accuracy of each draft measurement ranges from 0.1 m (ice profiling sonars (ips) deployed after 2006) to 0.2 m (es300 instruments before 2006), while the uncertainty of each individual measurement is not subject to bias errors and the summary error statistics of monthly values are less than 0.1 m57.\nthe current formulation contains three parameters to describe the dynamic ice thickening process: b (the proportionate thickening constant); \u03b1 (the areal probability of dynamic thickening); and m (the number of dynamic events). in this study, we briefly describe the sensitivity of the ice thickness distributions to these parameters. in general, a smaller (larger) thickening constant b decelerates (accelerates) the dynamic thickening process, that is, a smaller b gives a smaller variance and steeper modal peak of thickness distribution if \u03b1 and m are fixed. however, a large value of b (for example, b = 0.8, indicating that ridged ice can be 1.8 times thicker than the ice before an event at maximum) makes the distribution bimodal because the possible thickness gain at each dynamic event is far from the modal thickness and the ridged/rafted ice tends to generate another peak apart from the mode. therefore, the possible and realistic range of b should be examined further together with the probability density function of the thickening increment r by high-resolution observations in the future. the areal probability of dynamic thickening, \u03b1, also affects the evolution of the dynamic thickening process. a larger \u03b1 promotes dynamic thickening because a larger fraction of pack ice can be deformed at one event. the thickness dependency of the probability, equation (8), decelerates further thickening of thick ice. although values of b and \u03b1 affect the progress of dynamic thickening in the model, we obtained similar ice thickness distributions with a log-normal form sooner or later, that is, smaller b and \u03b1 can be compensated by a large m, the number of deformation events, indicating a robustness of the formulation. the resulting shape of the distribution, its temporal evolution (fig. 5) and its comparison with the observed change in distribution (fig. 1b) suggest that the proposed stochastic ice thickening model captures the essence of the dynamic thickening process that resulted in the observed changes in ice thickness distribution.",

        "context": "figure 2a shows the time series of ice thickness distribution in the fram strait for the last three decades. darker shading indicates a larger fraction of sea ice at the corresponding thickness. a zonal band with a darker shade ranging approximately from 3.0 m to 1.5 m, depicts the modal thickness of multi-year sea ice. the temporal variation of this band describes the long-term changes of modal sea ice thickness in the central arctic. the time series clearly shows that the change of the thickness distribution (fig. 1b) has not been a gradual process but that a distinct shift from thick and deformed ice regime to thinner and more uniform ice regime occurred around 2007 (visualized by the intensity of the shade at the modal peak in fig. 2a). the shift is further evidenced by coincident changes in modal peak height (fig. 2b) and the variance of ice thickness distribution (fig. 2c). the modal peak height and variance were obtained from a fitted log-normal function to each distribution (methods). the modal peak height gives a measure of compactness of the distribution around the mode, while the variance gives an indication of deformed fraction of sea ice relative to the modal peak. the sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts23 we applied to these time series detected a shift in both peak height and variance in 2007 (extended data fig. 6 and extended data table 1). this indicates that until 2007, ice floes consisted of sea ice with a variety of thicknesses towards thicker ice, whereas from 2007, they have consisted of ice of more uniform thickness with a smaller deformed fraction. this is also clearly visible in shifts with a 1-year delay in the fraction of thick ice (that is, ice thickness exceeding 4 and 5 m) shown in fig. 2d. this fraction corresponds to ice thicker than the maximum theoretical thickness of thermodynamically grown ice derived by different sea ice models24,25, that is, giving a measure of the fraction of dynamically deformed ice. the shift of ice thickness distribution in 2007 and 2008 indicates that a sudden reduction of dynamic forcing on the ice occurred at that time.\nreduced residence time of arctic sea ice figure 3a shows a time series of mean residence time of sea ice floes in the arctic ocean that arrived in the fram strait (methods). the timing of the observed shift in thickness distribution coincided with the timing of a reduction in residence time. the mean residence time showed a two-step shift from 4.3 years to 2.7 years in 2005 and 2007 (detected by sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts; methods). a coincident exceptional long residence time (fig. 3a) and large variance of thickness distribution (fig. 2c) occurred in 2017, reinforcing the connection between residence time and thickness distribution. although the mean residence time dropped in 2005 and 2007, the area of ice formation (coloured dots in fig. 3b,c) and ice trajectories across the arctic basins (grey cloud in fig. 3b,c) have not changed notably. the slight offshore and westward shift of ice formation areas26 is not sufficient to explain the reduction of residence time by approximately 1.6 years (fig. 3a and colour of the dots in fig. 3b,c).\ndata fig. 2). the mean residence time of ice floes in the siberian sector that arrived at the fram strait after 2007, was reduced from 15 to 6 months, indicating that most of the ice floes cannot survive the summer melt season and only new ice floes that formed after the summer enter the tpd.\nfigure 5 shows examples of the probability density function of xm for different m (methods). the plot demonstrates that the shorter residence (smaller m) gives higher modal peak and less deformed sea ice. the simple proportionate thickening process conceptually explains (1) the shape of the observed ice thickness distribution (the log-normal shapes in fig. 1b) and, more importantly, (2) the reduction of the fraction of deformed ice for the shorter residence time after 2007 (fig. 2).\nafter 2006, o(106) samples were used (interval of 2 s). the number of samples used were sufficient to derive thickness distribution on a monthly basis57. the number of data in each bin were divided by the total number of measurements to derive the distribution function. the open water fraction (that is, zero ice thickness) was excluded when deriving the function. distribution functions, including the open water fraction, are shown in extended data fig. 3. if the temporal coverage of the data samples was less than 15% of a monthly coverage, the distribution function was not defined and removed from the analysis. the draft thickness distributions were converted to ice thickness distributions by an average ratio of draft to thickness in the fram strait, 1.136 (ref. 62). although the ratio has some seasonal variability and might have slightly changed due to changes in ice density and snow load in different seasons and years, we assumed that the change was not considerable for the aim of the current analyses. a composite time series of ice thickness distribution (fig. 2a and extended data fig. 3) was obtained from a combination of available distribution functions from f11 to f14 . more specifically, one of the distribution functions from f11 to f14 was used with a priority order of f13, f14, f12, f11. the composite time series is shown in fig. 2a, while the time series at each site are shown in extended data fig. 4. the fractions of sea ice thicker than two thresholds, 4 and 5 m, were calculated as the cumulative function of all available distributions (that is, all distributions from f11 to f14) in each month and are shown in fig. 2d.\nwhere \u03c3f and \u03bcf are the fitting parameters, x is the ice thickness bin and f is the distribution function. to detect the second peak of the distributions that represents multi-year ice travelled across the arctic basin, a cut-off threshold was introduced. the threshold was used to exclude thin sea ice fraction, which is supposedly formed in the vicinity of the fram strait and is not representing basin-wide changes of ice properties in the arctic. we defined the threshold by the minimum between the first and second peak of each monthly mean distribution. a set of two consecutive negative gradients (towards thicker bins) followed by two consecutive positive gradients was used to detect the minimum (after applying 3-bin smoothing), while a threshold of 1.53 m (corresponding to 1.3 m of ice draft) was applied when an estimated threshold was thicker than 3 m. function values ranging lower than the threshold were set to zero (zero case) or excluded from the fitting (nan case). a least-square minimization was applied to fit a log-normal function to the distribution. in general, the fitted log-normal functions represent the distribution very well. the nan case slightly underestimates the modal peak, while the zero case captures the peak very well. examples of distribution functions, together with cut-off thresholds and fitted log-normal functions, are shown in extended data fig. 5. the modal peak of the log-normal function roughly gives the thickness of thermodynamically grown sea ice, while the variance of the function quantifies the deformed fraction of sea ice (dynamically thickened

        "context": "figure 2a shows the time series of ice thickness distribution in the fram strait for the last three decades. darker shading indicates a larger fraction of sea ice at the corresponding thickness. a zonal band with a darker shade ranging approximately from 3.0 m to 1.5 m, depicts the modal thickness of multi-year sea ice. the temporal variation of this band describes the long-term changes of modal sea ice thickness in the central arctic. the time series clearly shows that the change of the thickness distribution (fig. 1b) has not been a gradual process but that a distinct shift from thick and deformed ice regime to thinner and more uniform ice regime occurred around 2007 (visualized by the intensity of the shade at the modal peak in fig. 2a). the shift is further evidenced by coincident changes in modal peak height (fig. 2b) and the variance of ice thickness distribution (fig. 2c). the modal peak height and variance were obtained from a fitted log-normal function to each distribution (methods). the modal peak height gives a measure of compactness of the distribution around the mode, while the variance gives an indication of deformed fraction of sea ice relative to the modal peak. the sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts23 we applied to these time series detected a shift in both peak height and variance in 2007 (extended data fig. 6 and extended data table 1). this indicates that until 2007, ice floes consisted of sea ice with a variety of thicknesses towards thicker ice, whereas from 2007, they have consisted of ice of more uniform thickness with a smaller deformed fraction. this is also clearly visible in shifts with a 1-year delay in the fraction of thick ice (that is, ice thickness exceeding 4 and 5 m) shown in fig. 2d. this fraction corresponds to ice thicker than the maximum theoretical thickness of thermodynamically grown ice derived by different sea ice models24,25, that is, giving a measure of the fraction of dynamically deformed ice. the shift of ice thickness distribution in 2007 and 2008 indicates that a sudden reduction of dynamic forcing on the ice occurred at that time.\nreduced residence time of arctic sea ice figure 3a shows a time series of mean residence time of sea ice floes in the arctic ocean that arrived in the fram strait (methods). the timing of the observed shift in thickness distribution coincided with the timing of a reduction in residence time. the mean residence time showed a two-step shift from 4.3 years to 2.7 years in 2005 and 2007 (detected by sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts; methods). a coincident exceptional long residence time (fig. 3a) and large variance of thickness distribution (fig. 2c) occurred in 2017, reinforcing the connection between residence time and thickness distribution. although the mean residence time dropped in 2005 and 2007, the area of ice formation (coloured dots in fig. 3b,c) and ice trajectories across the arctic basins (grey cloud in fig. 3b,c) have not changed notably. the slight offshore and westward shift of ice formation areas26 is not sufficient to explain the reduction of residence time by approximately 1.6 years (fig. 3a and colour of the dots in fig. 3b,c).\ndata fig. 2). the mean residence time of ice floes in the siberian sector that arrived at the fram strait after 2007, was reduced from 15 to 6 months, indicating that most of the ice floes cannot survive the summer melt season and only new ice floes that formed after the summer enter the tpd.\nfigure 5 shows examples of the probability density function of xm for different m (methods). the plot demonstrates that the shorter residence (smaller m) gives higher modal peak and less deformed sea ice. the simple proportionate thickening process conceptually explains (1) the shape of the observed ice thickness distribution (the log-normal shapes in fig. 1b) and, more importantly, (2) the reduction of the fraction of deformed ice for the shorter residence time after 2007 (fig. 2).\nafter 2006, o(106) samples were used (interval of 2 s). the number of samples used were sufficient to derive thickness distribution on a monthly basis57. the number of data in each bin were divided by the total number of measurements to derive the distribution function. the open water fraction (that is, zero ice thickness) was excluded when deriving the function. distribution functions, including the open water fraction, are shown in extended data fig. 3. if the temporal coverage of the data samples was less than 15% of a monthly coverage, the distribution function was not defined and removed from the analysis. the draft thickness distributions were converted to ice thickness distributions by an average ratio of draft to thickness in the fram strait, 1.136 (ref. 62). although the ratio has some seasonal variability and might have slightly changed due to changes in ice density and snow load in different seasons and years, we assumed that the change was not considerable for the aim of the current analyses. a composite time series of ice thickness distribution (fig. 2a and extended data fig. 3) was obtained from a combination of available distribution functions from f11 to f14 . more specifically, one of the distribution functions from f11 to f14 was used with a priority order of f13, f14, f12, f11. the composite time series is shown in fig. 2a, while the time series at each site are shown in extended data fig. 4. the fractions of sea ice thicker than two thresholds, 4 and 5 m, were calculated as the cumulative function of all available distributions (that is, all distributions from f11 to f14) in each month and are shown in fig. 2d.\nwhere \u03c3f and \u03bcf are the fitting parameters, x is the ice thickness bin and f is the distribution function. to detect the second peak of the distributions that represents multi-year ice travelled across the arctic basin, a cut-off threshold was introduced. the threshold was used to exclude thin sea ice fraction, which is supposedly formed in the vicinity of the fram strait and is not representing basin-wide changes of ice properties in the arctic. we defined the threshold by the minimum between the first and second peak of each monthly mean distribution. a set of two consecutive negative gradients (towards thicker bins) followed by two consecutive positive gradients was used to detect the minimum (after applying 3-bin smoothing), while a threshold of 1.53 m (corresponding to 1.3 m of ice draft) was applied when an estimated threshold was thicker than 3 m. function values ranging lower than the threshold were set to zero (zero case) or excluded from the fitting (nan case). a least-square minimization was applied to fit a log-normal function to the distribution. in general, the fitted log-normal functions represent the distribution very well. the nan case slightly underestimates the modal peak, while the zero case captures the peak very well. examples of distribution functions, together with cut-off thresholds and fitted log-normal functions, are shown in extended data fig. 5. the modal peak of the log-normal function roughly gives the thickness of thermodynamically grown sea ice, while the variance of the function quantifies the deformed fraction of sea ice (dynamically thickened

distribution on a monthly basis57. the number of data in each bin were divided by the total number of measurements to derive the distribution function. the open water fraction (that is, zero ice thickness) was excluded when deriving the function. distribution functions, including the open water fraction, are shown in extended data fig. 3. if the temporal coverage of the data samples was less than 15% of a monthly coverage, the distribution function was not defined and removed from the analysis. the draft thickness distributions were converted to ice thickness distributions by an average ratio of draft to thickness in the fram strait, 1.136 (ref. 62). although the ratio has some seasonal variability and might have slightly changed due to changes in ice density and snow load in different seasons and years, we assumed that the change was not considerable for the aim of the current analyses. a composite time series of ice thickness distribution (fig. 2a and extended data fig. 3) was obtained from a combination of available distribution functions from f11 to f14 . more specifically, one of the distribution functions from f11 to f14 was used with a priority order of f13, f14, f12, f11. the composite time series is shown in fig. 2a, while the time series at each site are shown in extended data fig. 4. the fractions of sea ice thicker than two thresholds, 4 and 5 m, were calculated as the cumulative function of all available distributions (that is, all distributions from f11 to f14) in each month and are shown in fig. 2d.\nwhere \u03c3f and \u03bcf are the fitting parameters, x is the ice thickness bin and f is the distribution function. to detect the second peak of the distributions that represents multi-year ice travelled across the arctic basin, a cut-off threshold was introduced. the threshold was used to exclude thin sea ice fraction, which is supposedly formed in the vicinity of the fram strait and is not representing basin-wide changes of ice properties in the arctic. we defined the threshold by the minimum between the first and second peak of each monthly mean distribution. a set of two consecutive negative gradients (towards thicker bins) followed by two consecutive positive gradients was used to detect the minimum (after applying 3-bin smoothing), while a threshold of 1.53 m (corresponding to 1.3 m of ice draft) was applied when an estimated threshold was thicker than 3 m. function values ranging lower than the threshold were set to zero (zero case) or excluded from the fitting (nan case). a least-square minimization was applied to fit a log-normal function to the distribution. in general, the fitted log-normal functions represent the distribution very well. the nan case slightly underestimates the modal peak, while the zero case captures the peak very well. examples of distribution functions, together with cut-off thresholds and fitted log-normal functions, are shown in extended data fig. 5. the modal peak of the log-normal function roughly gives the thickness of thermodynamically grown sea ice, while the variance of the function quantifies the deformed fraction of sea ice (dynamically thickened thickness). changes in modal peak height and variance of the fitted log-normal functions, var(x) = exp (2\u03bcf + \u03c3f 2) (exp (\u03c3f 2) \u2212 1), for the last three decades are summarized in

        "context": "figure 2a shows the time series of ice thickness distribution in the fram strait for the last three decades. darker shading indicates a larger fraction of sea ice at the corresponding thickness. a zonal band with a darker shade ranging approximately from 3.0 m to 1.5 m, depicts the modal thickness of multi-year sea ice. the temporal variation of this band describes the long-term changes of modal sea ice thickness in the central arctic. the time series clearly shows that the change of the thickness distribution (fig. 1b) has not been a gradual process but that a distinct shift from thick and deformed ice regime to thinner and more uniform ice regime occurred around 2007 (visualized by the intensity of the shade at the modal peak in fig. 2a). the shift is further evidenced by coincident changes in modal peak height (fig. 2b) and the variance of ice thickness distribution (fig. 2c). the modal peak height and variance were obtained from a fitted log-normal function to each distribution (methods). the modal peak height gives a measure of compactness of the distribution around the mode, while the variance gives an indication of deformed fraction of sea ice relative to the modal peak. the sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts23 we applied to these time series detected a shift in both peak height and variance in 2007 (extended data fig. 6 and extended data table 1). this indicates that until 2007, ice floes consisted of sea ice with a variety of thicknesses towards thicker ice, whereas from 2007, they have consisted of ice of more uniform thickness with a smaller deformed fraction. this is also clearly visible in shifts with a 1-year delay in the fraction of thick ice (that is, ice thickness exceeding 4 and 5 m) shown in fig. 2d. this fraction corresponds to ice thicker than the maximum theoretical thickness of thermodynamically grown ice derived by different sea ice models24,25, that is, giving a measure of the fraction of dynamically deformed ice. the shift of ice thickness distribution in 2007 and 2008 indicates that a sudden reduction of dynamic forcing on the ice occurred at that time.\nreduced residence time of arctic sea ice figure 3a shows a time series of mean residence time of sea ice floes in the arctic ocean that arrived in the fram strait (methods). the timing of the observed shift in thickness distribution coincided with the timing of a reduction in residence time. the mean residence time showed a two-step shift from 4.3 years to 2.7 years in 2005 and 2007 (detected by sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts; methods). a coincident exceptional long residence time (fig. 3a) and large variance of thickness distribution (fig. 2c) occurred in 2017, reinforcing the connection between residence time and thickness distribution. although the mean residence time dropped in 2005 and 2007, the area of ice formation (coloured dots in fig. 3b,c) and ice trajectories across the arctic basins (grey cloud in fig. 3b,c) have not changed notably. the slight offshore and westward shift of ice formation areas26 is not sufficient to explain the reduction of residence time by approximately 1.6 years (fig. 3a and colour of the dots in fig. 3b,c).\ndata fig. 2). the mean residence time of ice floes in the siberian sector that arrived at the fram strait after 2007, was reduced from 15 to 6 months, indicating that most of the ice floes cannot survive the summer melt season and only new ice floes that formed after the summer enter the tpd.\nfigure 5 shows examples of the probability density function of xm for different m (methods). the plot demonstrates that the shorter residence (smaller m) gives higher modal peak and less deformed sea ice. the simple proportionate thickening process conceptually explains (1) the shape of the observed ice thickness distribution (the log-normal shapes in fig. 1b) and, more importantly, (2) the reduction of the fraction of deformed ice for the shorter residence time after 2007 (fig. 2).\nafter 2006, o(106) samples were used (interval of 2 s). the number of samples used were sufficient to derive thickness

        "context": "long-term mooring observations enable a direct estimate of the occurrence of ocean temperature extremes and their vertical structure. for instance, at the woods hole oceanographic institution hawaii ocean timeseries site (whots) in the north pacific ocean, 20 mhws (23 mcss) with a mean duration of 24 (21) days and intensity of 1 (0.8) \u00b0c were observed near the sea surface (15 m) between august 2004 and march 2020 (fig. 1 and extended data fig. 2). both the number and intensity of mhws and mcss increase with depth, doubling at 155 m, accompanied by a 50% decrease in their duration. in addition, the occurrence of mhws and mcss in the subsurface layer decouples in time from surface events. below a depth of 100 m, over 80% of mhw and mcs days do not coincide with surface signals (fig. 1k). the same decoupling rate has been observed at the other mooring sites in different ocean basins (extended data fig. 3a,b) and is much greater than those derived from model simulations where mesoscale activities are not well resolved18. this decoupling of subsurface temperature extremes from surface events is in line with the decrease in temporal correlation between subsurface and surface temperature anomalies with depth\n(fig. 1k and extended data fig. 3c). by comparison, the evolution of subsurface temperature is more closely related to that of sea-level anomaly (sla) (extended data fig. 3d), implying a greater influence of ocean dynamics than air\u2013sea heat exchange on subsurface temperature extremes.\nsatellite-based eddy observations show that the whots was located within (one radius of) aes (ces) for 17% (11%) of the observation period (fig. 1b\u2013g,l). however, the mooring observations show that, near the sea surface, 31% (18%) of the mhw (mcs) days were observed within aes (ces) (fig. 1l). this increased occurrence of temperature extremes within eddies seems to support previous model simulations that eddies are important drivers of surface mhws34. however, the surface events do not coincide closely in time with the occurrence of eddies and also last longer than the duration of the eddies passing through the site (fig. 1i and extended data fig. 2a). these features suggest that the influence of eddies on surface mhws and mcss is likely to be less dominant than other surface forcings15.\nit is interesting that the temporal consistency between temperature extremes and eddies increases with depth (extended data fig. 2). at a depth of 155 m, up to 48% (53%) of the identified mhw (mcs) days were observed within aes (ces) (fig. 1l). by contrast, no mhw (mcs) days were observed within ces (aes). when counting the number of extreme events, 20 out of 37 (54%) mhws co-occurred with aes, and 18 out of 36 (50%) mcss co-occurred with ces (extended data table 2). a similarly high co-occurrence of subsurface mhws (mcss) with aes (ces) was observed at the other mooring sites (fig. 2 and extended data fig. 4). this is even more true for extreme mhw (mcs) events above the 95th (below the 5th) percentile of temperature variability (extended data table 2), suggesting an even stronger influence of eddies on more severe extreme temperature events.\ncharacterizing extreme temperature events below the ocean surface has long been a challenging task due to the lack of long-term in situ observations. in this study, we analysed the daily evolution of sea-water temperatures recorded by eight mooring sites in various ocean basins, and show that the occurrence of the majority of subsurface mhws and mcss do not concur with surface events (fig. 1\nas areas that are home to the vast majority of marine organisms, mhws and mcss in the subsurface ocean are of particular ecological concern9,14. furthermore, a large portion of temperature extremes co-occur with extremes of acidification, hypoxia and/or low primary productivity19,46. these compound events are starting to receive particular attention because of their joint harmful impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems in comparison with individual extremes13,47. however, to date, our knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for these events is very limited. in this study, we have demonstrated the important role of eddies in driving subsurface mhws and mcss (fig. 1). given that eddies redistribute not only heat but also nutrients, oxygen and organisms in the ocean48,49, they might also be important drivers of these biogeochemical extremes and even dual or triple compound events. additionally, we have revealed a growing impact of ocean eddies on mhws and mcss with warming of the global ocean (fig. 5).\ndata used to outline the horizontal structure of the eddies in fig. 1 was obtained from the copernicus marine environment monitoring service.\nfor each mooring site, the variation in water temperature is assumed to be influenced by the nearest eddy. thus, we associated the site with the eddy nearest to it on each sampling day. the distance of the site to the associated eddy was normalized by the radius of the eddy (r) to facilitate the comparison of eddies of different sizes (fig. 1g,h). then, the percentage of mhw (mcs) days observed within the interiors (one radius) of aes and ces were computed for each observation depth, respectively. for an mhw (mcs) event, if an eddy was detected during the period (any of the mhw (mcs) days was detected within the radius of an eddy), it was defined as co-occurring with the eddy.\nmooring site. a, mhws (red patches) and mcss (blue patches) identified from daily temperature

institution hawaii ocean timeseries site (whots) in the north pacific ocean, 20 mhws (23 mcss) with a mean duration of 24 (21) days and intensity of 1 (0.8) \u00b0c were observed near the sea surface (15 m) between august 2004 and march 2020 (fig. 1 and extended data fig. 2). both the number and intensity of mhws and mcss increase with depth, doubling at 155 m, accompanied by a 50% decrease in their duration. in addition, the occurrence of mhws and mcss in the subsurface layer decouples in time from surface events. below a depth of 100 m, over 80% of mhw and mcs days do not coincide with surface signals (fig. 1k). the same decoupling rate has been observed at the other mooring sites in different ocean basins (extended data fig. 3a,b) and is much greater than those derived from model simulations where mesoscale activities are not well resolved18. this decoupling of subsurface temperature extremes from surface events is in line with the decrease in temporal correlation between subsurface and surface temperature anomalies with depth\n(fig. 1k and extended data fig. 3c). by comparison, the evolution of subsurface temperature is more closely related to that of sea-level anomaly (sla) (extended data fig. 3d), implying a greater influence of ocean dynamics than air\u2013sea heat exchange on subsurface temperature extremes.\nsatellite-based eddy observations show that the whots was located within (one radius of) aes (ces) for 17% (11%) of the observation period (fig. 1b\u2013g,l). however, the mooring observations show that, near the sea surface, 31% (18%) of the mhw (mcs) days were observed within aes (ces) (fig. 1l). this increased occurrence of temperature extremes within eddies seems to support previous model simulations that eddies are important drivers of surface mhws34. however, the surface events do not coincide closely in time with the occurrence of eddies and also last longer than the duration of the eddies passing through the site (fig. 1i and extended data fig. 2a). these features suggest that the influence of eddies on surface mhws and mcss is likely to be less dominant than other surface forcings15.\nit is interesting that the temporal consistency between temperature extremes and eddies increases with depth (extended data fig. 2). at a depth of 155 m, up to 48% (53%) of the identified mhw (mcs) days were observed within aes (ces) (fig. 1l). by contrast, no mhw (mcs) days were observed within ces (aes). when counting the number of extreme events, 20 out of 37 (54%) mhws co-occurred with aes, and 18 out of 36 (50%) mcss co-occurred with ces (extended data table 2). a similarly high co-occurrence of subsurface mhws (mcss) with aes (ces) was observed at the other mooring sites (fig. 2 and extended data fig. 4). this is even more true for extreme mhw (mcs) events above the 95th (below the 5th) percentile of temperature variability (extended data table 2), suggesting an even stronger influence of eddies on more severe extreme temperature events.\ncharacterizing extreme temperature events below the ocean surface has long been a challenging task due to the lack of long-term in situ observations. in this study, we analysed the daily evolution of sea-water temperatures recorded by eight mooring sites in various ocean basins, and show that the occurrence of the majority of subsurface mhws and mcss do not concur with surface events (fig. 1\nas areas that are home to the vast majority of marine organisms, mhws and mcss in the subsurface ocean are of particular ecological concern9,14. furthermore, a large portion of temperature extremes co-occur with extremes of acidification, hypoxia and/or low primary productivity19,46. these compound events are starting to receive particular attention because of their joint harmful impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems in comparison with individual extremes13,47. however, to date, our knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for these events is very limited. in this study, we have demonstrated the important role of eddies in driving subsurface mhws and mcss (fig. 1). given that eddies redistribute not only heat but also nutrients, oxygen and organisms in the ocean48,49, they might also be important drivers of these biogeochemical extremes and even dual or triple compound events. additionally, we have revealed a growing impact of ocean eddies on mhws and mcss with warming of the global ocean (fig. 5).\ndata used to outline the horizontal structure of the eddies in fig. 1 was obtained from the copernicus marine environment monitoring service.\nfor each mooring site, the variation in water temperature is assumed to be influenced by the nearest eddy. thus, we associated the site with the eddy nearest to it on each sampling day. the distance of the site to the associated eddy was normalized by the radius of the eddy (r) to facilitate the comparison of eddies of different sizes (fig. 1g,h). then, the percentage of mhw (mcs) days observed within the interiors (one radius) of aes and ces were computed for each observation depth, respectively. for an mhw (mcs) event, if an eddy was detected during the period (any of the mhw (mcs) days was detected within the radius of an eddy), it was defined as co-occurring with the eddy.\nmooring site. a, mhws (red patches) and mcss (blue patches) identified from daily temperature

        "context": "to gain insights into the metabolic interactions between ca. t. diatomicola and its haslea host, we studied the ca. t. diatomicola genome together with its in situ transcriptome. the ca. t. diatomicola genome encodes all genes necessary for n2 fixation to ammonia, most of which were highly transcribed (fig. 2a,b and supplementary table 1). these include key genes encoding the nitrogenase (nifh, nifd and nifk) and the iron-molybdenum cofactor assembly proteins (nife, nifn and nifb).\nca. t. diatomicola has a strongly reduced genome size, but the genome still encodes core carbon-processing pathways such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle, which are present in many heterotrophic bacteria. however, on the basis of the low transcription of glycolysis genes (supplementary table 1), ca. t. diatomicola probably does not grow on sugars. instead, many genes involved in the tca cycle were highly transcribed, in particular malate (mdh) and succinate (sdh) using enzymes (fig. 2a,b and supplementary table 1), indicating growth on dicarboxylic acids. the dicarboxylates can be converted via pyruvate to acetyl-coa, driving the tca cycle independent of the glycolysis pathway (fig. 2b). this is supported by the high transcription of genes encoding a trap-type dicarboxylic acid transporter (dctp, dctq and dctm) and enzymes that decarboxylate malate (maeb) and oxaloacetate (pcka and pyk) to phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate. on the basis of the combined genomic and transcriptomic data, it seems that the n2-fixing ca. t. diatomicola provides ammonia to the haslea\ndiatom host in return for dicarboxylic acids (fig. 2b). this metabolite exchange is strongly reminiscent of the metabolic interaction in rhizobia\u2013legume symbioses29,30, in which n2-fixing rhizobia grow on host-provided dicarboxylic acids, such as succinate and malate, and in return provide fixed nitrogen to the host plant. by contrast, in symbioses between marine diatoms and n2-fixing cyanobacteria, both partners are photosynthetic and grow on inorganic carbon31.\nnotably, ca. t. diatomicola seems to have lost its low-affinity terminal oxidase (supplementary table 1), which is typically present in other members of the hyphomicrobiaceae family, with the notable exception of ca. t. profundi (supplementary table 3). instead, ca. t. diatomicola encodes and highly transcribes the high-affinity cytochrome cbb3-type (ccon, ccoo and ccop) terminal oxidase (fig. 2a, extended data fig. 6 and supplementary table 1), which is used for respiration under low-oxygen conditions, and is generally poorly transcribed in high-oxygen environments such as the oxic surface waters of the tropical north atlantic32. legume-associated n2-fixing rhizobia also rely on high-affinity terminal oxidases when growing symbiotically29, because the plant hosts restrict the oxygen supply to the symbionts to control their growth and optimize nitrogen fixation33. the legume hosts also suppress the activity of the amt-type ammonium transporters of nodulating rhizobia, to prevent the uptake of ammonium by the bacteria and to enhance ammonium transfer to the plant30. the lack of amt transporters in ca. t. diatomicola would similarly maximize the transfer of ammonia to the haslea host. ca. t. diatomicola seems to lack the capacity for de novo biosynthesis of some essential amino acids (aromatic amino acids, histidine and proline) and vitamins (for example, biotin and thiamine; supplementary table 1), a trait also found in nodulating rhizobiales that are dependent on their plant host for these essential compounds34,35. together, these results indicate that,\ncandidatus tectiglobus diatomicola transcriptome analysis to obtain gene transcription information for ca. t. diatomicola, all sequenced metatranscriptome reads were combined and mapped to the ca. t. diatomicola genome using bwa-mem61 v.0.7.17-r1188, and the resulting mapping files were filtered requiring at least 95% sequence identity and at least 80% of the read to align (mapping and filtering were done through coverm v.0.6.1). gene counts were generated using featurecounts62 v.2.0.1 and tpm values for protein-coding genes were calculated as previously described63. the genome plot (fig. 2a) including tpm values was generated using brig64 v.0.95 and dnaplotter65 v.18.1.0.",

        "context": "to confirm that ca. t. diatomicola fixes n2, we measured the assimilation of 15n from 15n2 in individual ca. t. diatomicola\u2013haslea symbioses using nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanosims). all investigated ca. t. diatomicola cells fixed 15n2 and more than 99% of the fixed nitrogen was subsequently transferred to the diatom host, which is likely to have been facilitated by the lack of amt transporters in ca. t. diatomicola (fig. 3a,c). as such, the symbiont fixed 100-fold more nitrogen than would be needed for its own growth, which is similar to previous reports for n2-fixing cyanobacteria\u2013diatom symbioses\n26. single-cell uptake of 13c carbon from 13co2, measured simultaneously with n2 fixation, revealed that the photosynthetic diatom in return transferred around 1% of fixed carbon to the symbiont for growth (fig. 3b,c). the carbon supplied by the diatom might also be stored as glycogen, lipids or calvin\u2013benson\u2013bassham-cycle products, as indicated by the carbon-rich biomass of the symbiont relative to the diatom host (extended data fig. 7). similar to nodulating rhizobia, ca. t. diatomicola might store reduced carbon compounds to regulate its carbon flux and act as reductant storage30. furthermore, on the basis of the similar 13c enrichments, both ca. t. diatomicola and the haslea host have comparable carbon-based growth rates (0.6 \u00b1 0.3 and 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 divisions per day (mean \u00b1 s.d.), respectively; fig. 3d). when considered together with microscopic observations of dividing ca. t. diatomicola\u2013haslea symbioses, this indicates the coordinated division of the symbiotic partners and vertical transmission of the symbiont (extended data fig. 4a\u2013d). such an intricate coordination between host and symbiont growth is required for the long-term persistence and stability of a symbiosis36. moreover, the fast growth of the rhizobia\u2013diatom symbioses (mean, around 0.8 d\u22121; extended data table 1) relative to the\nto assess the relative importance of the ca. t. diatomicola\u2013haslea symbiosis for n2 fixation in surface waters of the tropical north atlantic, we calculated their total n2 fixation activity on the basis of their cellular n2 fixation rates and abundance. owing to the large transfer of nitrogen from the ca. t. diatomicola symbiont to its host diatom (fig. 3a,c), the biomass of both ca. t. diatomicola and its haslea host was considered for calculations (see supplementary methods). on average, n2 fixation rates for the ca. t. diatomicola\u2013haslea symbiosis were around 650 fmol n d\u22121, which equates to around 1.5 nmol n l\u22121 d\u22121 on the basis of its in situ abundance (around 2,000 cells per litre; extended data table 1). this is comparable to the combined contribution of the most abundant cyanobacteria\u2013diatom symbioses that we observed in these waters: the cyanobacterium richelia, which associates with the diatoms hemiaulus and guinardia (around 1.6 nmol n l\u22121 d\u22121; extended data table 1). moreover, n2 fixation by the ca. t. diatomicola\u2013haslea symbiosis is in the same range of n2 fixation previously reported from this region for the most abundant cyanobacterial n2 fixers trichodesmium and ucyn-a (up to 4 and 1.5 nmol n l\u22121 d\u22121, respectively)10. to our knowledge, our nanosims measurements present the first direct quantitative results showing that non-cyanobacterial heterotrophic n2 fixers fix nitrogen in situ at rates that can account for a substantial part of the high n2 fixation in the tropical north atlantic.\nfor fig. 3a,b, the correlative nanosims images are representative of a total of 16 diatoms (containing a total of 64 symbionts) from 3 independent environmental samples.\ncarbon-rich symbionts embedded in nitrogen-rich host biomass. the image shows the same \u2018ca. t. diatomicola\u2019\u2013haslea symbiosis as in fig. 3a,b. se, secondary electrons. scale bar, 5 \u00b5m.",

        "context": "modern north atlantic circulation is characterized by two main interconnected systems: first, the basin-wide atlantic meridional overturning circulation (amoc), which is a complex system of surface and deep ocean currents that results in vertical overturning. the upper cell of the amoc transports warm and salty surface and thermocline waters northwards into the high-latitude north atlantic, in which these waters undergo intense cooling, causing buoyancy loss and subsequent sinking. the resultant dense water masses, known collectively as north atlantic deep water (nadw), flow southwards at depth (1\u20134 km), in part through the deep western boundary current (dwbc), which primarily follows the contours of the eastern american continental slope8,9. second, the north atlantic is also characterized by horizontal, predominantly wind-driven, gyre circulation, composed of an anticyclonic stg and the quasi-cyclonic subpolar gyre (spg)10, both of which also form part of the upper amoc cell. for example, in the subtropical north atlantic, upper amoc flow is carried by the western boundary current of the north atlantic stg that includes the gulf stream, which flows northwards from the tropics along the east coast of north america, eventually separating from the coast at cape hatteras11. continuing work is focused on better understanding how these two main circulation systems (the vertical overturning and horizontal gyres) are related in the modern ocean12. this includes a recognition that the stg circulation is a substantial contributor to the amoc and its attendant northwards heat transport, brought about by low-latitude buoyancy loss and stmw formation13\u201315. many previous studies have explored how north atlantic circulation may have altered under fundamentally different past climate states such as the lgm (19\u201323 thousand years ago (ka))7,16\u201320, when global mean temperatures were roughly 6 \u00b0c cooler21, ice sheets were at their maximum extent22 and sea levels were approximately 120\u2013135 m lower than today23. however, there are few glacial data from the northwest atlantic, in which both the gulf stream and the dwbc transit and a sharp boundary between the stg and spg is located; thus, hydrographic reconstructions from this crucial transition region provide an opportunity to investigate both vertical and horizontal components of atlantic circulation during the lgm. here we do this by generating new profiles of stable oxygen isotope data from two depth transects located at cape hatteras\u2013hudson canyon levee (henceforth cape hatteras) and blake outer ridge. depth transects at cape hatteras and blake outer ridge are formed of 10 and 11 marine sediment cores, respectively, and span between about 0.6 and 5.0 km water depth (fig. 1 and extended data table 1). today, both transects are bathed by the dwbc below about 1 km (ref. 24), but at shallower depths, the stg is more influential at blake outer ridge. by comparison, cores from above 1 km in the cape hatteras transect are situated inshore of the gulf stream detachment point and as far north as hudson canyon levee (methods), thus they are predominantly bathed by southwards flowing slope waters of subpolar origin that occupy the upper ocean inshore of the gulf stream25. because there was no change in the latitude of the gulf stream detachment point\nacknowledgements we thank the whoi seafloor samples laboratory, including e. roosen, m. starr, a. patterson and g. nissen, and h. kuhlmann at the iodp bremen core repository for their help with core sampling; e. cheng for laboratory assistance; d. fairman, p. goh and e. papachristopoulou for assistance with processing sediment samples; g. loader for help collecting benthic stable isotope data from knr-178-48jpc; j. rolfe for stable isotope analyses; the natural environmental research council (nerc) neif radiocarbon laboratory, uc irvine kccams facility and whoi nosams for radiocarbon dating; c. brierley, j. hirschi, j. holmes, j. lynch-stieglitz, j. marotzke, j. rae and f. zhu for discussions; m. wheeler for helping design fig. 1; and j. zhu, f. lhardy and the pmip community for sharing pmip model data. j.h.w. was supported by the london nerc doctoral training partnership (grant no. ne/l002485/1). this project has received funding from nerc project reconamoc (ne/s009736/1), the leverhulme trust, nsf grants oce-1304291 and oce-2103049, the european union\u2019s horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement nos. 678760 (atlas) and 818123 (iatlantic), and the european union's horizon europe project 101059547-epoc. this paper reflects only the authors\u2019 views, and the european union cannot be held responsible for any use that may be made of the information contained herein. for the purpose of open access, the author has applied a creative commons attribution (cc by) licence to any author accepted manuscript version arising.",

        "context": "modern north atlantic circulation is characterized by two main interconnected systems: first, the basin-wide atlantic meridional overturning circulation (amoc), which is a complex system of surface and deep ocean currents that results in vertical overturning. the upper cell of the amoc transports warm and salty surface and thermocline waters northwards into the high-latitude north atlantic, in which these waters undergo intense cooling, causing buoyancy loss and subsequent sinking. the resultant dense water masses, known collectively as north atlantic deep water (nadw), flow southwards at depth (1\u20134 km), in part through the deep western boundary current (dwbc), which primarily follows the contours of the eastern american continental slope8,9. second, the north atlantic is also characterized by horizontal, predominantly wind-driven, gyre circulation, composed of an anticyclonic stg and the quasi-cyclonic subpolar gyre (spg)10, both of which also form part of the upper amoc cell. for example, in the subtropical north atlantic, upper amoc flow is carried by the western boundary current of the north atlantic stg that includes the gulf stream, which flows northwards from the tropics along the east coast of north america, eventually separating from the coast at cape hatteras11. continuing work is focused on better understanding how these two main circulation systems (the vertical overturning and horizontal gyres) are related in the modern ocean12. this includes a recognition that the stg circulation is a substantial contributor to the amoc and its attendant northwards heat transport, brought about by low-latitude buoyancy loss and stmw formation13\u201315. many previous studies have explored how north atlantic circulation may have altered under fundamentally different past climate states such as the lgm (19\u201323 thousand years ago (ka))7,16\u201320, when global mean temperatures were roughly 6 \u00b0c cooler21, ice sheets were at their maximum extent22 and sea levels were approximately 120\u2013135 m lower than today23. however, there are few glacial data from the northwest atlantic, in which both the gulf stream and the dwbc transit and a sharp boundary between the stg and spg is located; thus, hydrographic reconstructions from this crucial transition region provide an opportunity to investigate both vertical and horizontal components of atlantic circulation during the lgm. here we do this by generating new profiles of stable oxygen isotope data from two depth transects located at cape hatteras\u2013hudson canyon levee (henceforth cape hatteras) and blake outer ridge. depth transects at cape hatteras and blake outer ridge are formed of 10 and 11 marine sediment cores, respectively, and span between about 0.6 and 5.0 km water depth (fig. 1 and extended data table 1). today, both transects are bathed by the dwbc below about 1 km (ref. 24), but at shallower depths, the stg is more influential at blake outer ridge. by comparison, cores from above 1 km in the cape hatteras transect are situated inshore of the gulf stream detachment point and as far north as hudson canyon levee (methods), thus they are predominantly bathed by southwards flowing slope waters of subpolar origin that occupy the upper ocean inshore of the gulf stream25. because there was no change in the latitude of the gulf stream detachment point\nacknowledgements we thank the whoi seafloor samples laboratory, including e. roosen, m. starr, a. patterson and g. nissen, and h. kuhlmann at the iodp bremen core repository for their help with core sampling; e. cheng for laboratory assistance; d. fairman, p. goh and e. papachristopoulou for assistance with processing sediment samples; g. loader for help collecting benthic stable isotope data from knr-178-48jpc; j. rolfe for stable isotope analyses; the natural environmental research council (nerc) neif radiocarbon laboratory, uc irvine kccams facility and whoi nosams for radiocarbon dating; c. brierley, j. hirschi, j. holmes, j. lynch-stieglitz, j. marotzke, j. rae and f. zhu for discussions; m. wheeler for helping design fig. 1; and j. zhu, f. lhardy and the pmip community for sharing pmip model data. j.h.w. was supported by the london nerc doctoral training partnership (grant no. ne/l002485/1). this project has received funding from nerc project reconamoc (ne/s009736/1), the leverhulme trust, nsf grants oce-1304291 and oce-2103049, the european union\u2019s horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement nos. 678760 (atlas) and 818123 (iatlantic), and the european union's horizon europe project 101059547-epoc. this paper reflects only the authors\u2019 views, and the european union cannot be held responsible for any use that may be made of the information contained herein. for the purpose of open access, the author has applied a creative commons attribution (cc by) licence to any author accepted manuscript version arising.",

\u20180\u2019 refers to the previous year and \u20181\u2019 for the first year) (fig. 1b), which generates a large upper-ocean heat discharge that\u2014in turn\u2014 induces a strong first-year la ni\u00f1a condition in d(1)jf(2) (in which \u20182\u2019 refers to the second year;

extended data fig. 3). second, the models reproduce the meridionally broad sst structure of multi-year la ni\u00f1a in d(1)jf(2) that is connected to extratropical climate variations6,7; in contrast, the anomalies of a single-year la ni\u00f1a is narrower and more equatorially confined (fig. 1c,d). such a tropical\u2013subtropical connection during multi-year la ni\u00f1a can be traced to mam(1), when the precursory northeasterly and cold sst anomalies appear in the subtropical north pacific and extend to the equator as a negative npmm-like pattern (extended data fig. 4).\ntwenty-first century (2000\u20132099) under a high-emission warming scenario (shared socioeconomic pathway 5-8.5 (ssp585)) in each of the 20 selected models. we focus on the ssp585 scenario and discuss other scenarios as sensitivity tests. in aggregation, the frequency of multi-year la ni\u00f1a increases from one event every 12.1 years in 1900\u20131999 (166 events in 2,000 years, which cover 20 100-year periods from 20 models) to one event every 9.1 years in 2000\u20132099 (220 events in 2,000 years). the multi-model mean increase of 33 \u00b1 13% is statistically significant above the 95% confidence level according to a bootstrap test (see \u2018statistical significance test\u2019 in methods), underscored by a strong inter-model agreement with a total of 15 out of 20 models (75%) simulating more multi-year la ni\u00f1a events in the warmer twenty-first century (fig. 2a). the inter-model consensus mainly reflects an increased occurrence of \u2018double\u2019 la ni\u00f1a (events that last two years), whereas there is no inter-model agreement on how \u2018triple\u2019 la ni\u00f1a (events that last three years) may change under greenhouse warming (see \u2018sensitivity of projected increase in multi-year la ni\u00f1a occurrence\u2019 in methods). on the other hand, the frequency of multi-year la ni\u00f1a is underestimated and shows no marked change in the non-selected models (fig. 2a), which possibly relates to the overly weak nonlinear enso dynamics (fig. 1a).\nthe joint impact from the two warming maxima under greenhouse warming is a negative npmm-like pattern in response to a positive eastern pacific ni\u00f1o3 sst anomaly in d(0)jf(1) that is not only northward broadened but also more sensitive to el ni\u00f1o warm anomalies in the twenty-first century (fig. 4d). as the pattern of northward-broadened easterly anomalies occurs more frequently owing to the increased sensitivity, the associated heat recharge of the equatorial pacific slows, leading to a colder upper-ocean condition and more frequent multi-year la ni\u00f1a events (supplementary fig. 10). that these mechanisms operate is underscored by an inter-model correlation after excluding the strong el ni\u00f1o events, in which models that simulate the two stronger warming maxima similarly simulate a greater increase in multi-year la ni\u00f1a events (supplementary fig. 11).\nwe take outputs from 37 cmip6 models over the 1900\u20132099 period, in which monthly data are available for ocean temperature, sst, surface winds, slp, heat flux and ssh. these models are forced under historical anthropogenic and natural forcings up to 2014 and thereafter future greenhouse-gas forcing under the ssp585 emission scenario till 2100 (ref. 14). we compare changes in multi-year la ni\u00f1a events between the twentieth (1900\u20131999) and twenty-first (2000\u20132099) centuries. monthly anomalies of all variables from models are obtained with reference to the monthly climatology of 1900\u20131999 and quadratically detrended. as expected, the definition of events and the choice of period over which climatology is calculated could affect our results. as a test, we calculate anomalies separately for 1900\u20131999 and 2000\u2013 2099 with reference to the respective monthly climatology. although changes in individual models occur, the mme results hold (supplementary fig. 12). before the analysis, outputs of each model are re-gridded into a common 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 resolution.\non recent observed changes, the last 40 years seem to have witnessed more frequent multi-year la ni\u00f1a events under a stronger mean-state warming in the western than the eastern tropical pacific63. however, the current observational record is subject to much uncertainty, especially in the first half of the twentieth century64, meaning that the observed change itself may not be relied on without any further corroborating evidence. although models tend to underestimate the recent sst warming trend between the western and eastern equatorial pacific63, there are models that are able to simulate both an increase in multi-year la ni\u00f1a frequency and a faster warming in the western than the eastern equatorial pacific in 1981\u20132020 than 1941\u20131980 (supplementary fig. 13a), suggesting an influence from natural variability on recent multi-year la ni\u00f1a change.",

fig. 4a) and u03_hos (r = 0.93; fig. 4d), excluding 4 outlying models in 4xco2 (shaded orange in fig. 4a). these four models have anomalously strong future amocs owing to notable atlantic or indo-pacific residual upwelling pathways (fig. 2a\u2013d). these upwelling pathways are unrealistically large in the control simulations relative to the observed amoc strength (fig. 2b,d) or they have anomalously weak decreases in the future state (fig. 2b,d, brown triangles).\nin ref. 3, we showed that in a transient state, changes in amoc strength are balanced by changes in the amoc\u2019s upwelling pathways, and vice versa. these changes are communicated rapidly by non-advective wave processes31, ensuring a global upwelling\u2013downwelling balance to conserve volume. thus, on a decadal or longer timescale, the time-mean amoc upwelling pathways are equal to the time-mean amoc strength (fig. 2). changes in the meridional overturning circulation remote from, but connected to, the north atlantic through the overturning streamfunction therefore modulate the amoc strength, even if the amoc weakening is instigated by changes in north atlantic forcing.\nas they cannot bypass the pmoc. this scenario occurs in the future state of all models with a pmoc (extended data figs. 2 and 3), ensuring that indopac_residualup is zero (fig. 2d,h). if southernocean_ up, calculated from the first expression on the right-hand side of equation (3), exceeds the amoc transport into the so (amocmin; grey circle in extended data fig. 10), we adjust southernocean_up to match amocmin (second expression on the right-hand side of equation (3)). this ensures that the amoc\u2019s so upwelling pathway is not stronger than the amoc transport into the so, as required by conservation of volume. we therefore implicitly account for the impact of the pmoc on the amoc\u2019s so upwelling pathway in this case, based on conservation of volume. we account for the pmoc implicitly rather than explicitly to prevent inaccuracies in the upwelling pathways that would otherwise occur in the following scenarios. 1. if the pmoc maximum is below z_amoc_34s, then amoc deep waters\nour approach is validated by indopac_residualup tending rapidly (over several decades) towards zero (fig. 2d,h) before we constrain it to zero by setting southernocean_up to amocmin (second expression on the right-hand side of equation (3)). the pmoc rapidly expands, preventing upwelling above the pmoc\u2019s base. therefore, indopac_ residualup quickly tends to zero when a pmoc forms. our approach is further validated by the strong correlation between the inverse future pmoc strength and the change in the amoc\u2019s so upwelling pathway (fig. 4a,c), despite our approach not explicitly accounting for the pmoc in the future-state calculations (when southernocean_up is set to amocmin). the outlying cesm2-based models in fig. 4c,f and fig. 5b,d (purple shading) emphasize the importance of implicitly accounting for the pmoc in the future state to prevent inaccuracies in the magnitude of southernocean_up (see scenario 1 above). we further validated our method by examining the overturning streamfunctions across models and experiments for inconsistencies with their calculated upwelling pathways.",

        "context": "cell in the indo-pacific and a clockwise wind-driven upper cell in the so (fig. 1a\u2013c and extended data fig. 1). however, models vary widely in amoc strength and their upwelling pathways (year 0 in fig. 2a\u2013d).\nunder ghg and freshwater forcings, all models show amoc weakening with a wide spread (fig. 2a,e), levelling off within 90 years (the \u2018future\u2019 state herein). the amoc weakens by 20\u201381% (mean of 54%) 90 years after 4xco2 forcing. considering only the u03_hos model subset, the weakening ranges from 50\u201380% in both 4xco2 (mean of 56%) and u03_hos (mean of 61%). thus, the future amoc strength differs across the models, leading to radically different climate impacts2.\namoc resilience under extreme forcing under the extreme climate forcings, all amoc upwelling pathways ultimately weaken to conserve volume as the amoc weakens, ensuring upwelling balances downwelling, but there is large intermodel spread (fig. 2b\u2013d,f\u2013h). the atlantic (fig. 2b,f) and indo-pacific residual (fig. 2d,h) upwelling pathways weaken to approximately zero in most models after 90 years of forcing owing to amoc shoaling, which reduces \u2018cell overlap\u2019 between the amoc and the so lower cell (fig. 1a and extended data figs. 2 and 3), cutting off the amoc\u2019s main pathway into the indo-pacific ocean37\u201339 (compare fig. 1c,d). rapid changes in the indo-pacific meridional overturning circulation triggered by wave processes as the amoc weakens31 also reduce the indo-pacific residual upwelling pathway. the future atlantic upwelling pathway is greater in u03_hos than in 4xco2, but it is diminished in both scenarios (<2 sv in most models; fig. 2b,f). in 4xco2, the so upwelling pathway initially increases (over years 10 to 30) owing to so upper cell strengthening, before it decreases (fig. 2c). the future so upwelling pathway is therefore greater in 4xco2 than in u03_hos (extended data fig. 8c,g), but it is the dominant upwelling pathway (2\u201313 sv) in both scenarios (fig. 2c,g), sustaining the future amoc. this suggests that without so upwelling, the amoc would nearly collapse under these forcings as the atlantic and indo-pacific residual upwelling pathways would still\nas the future so upwelling pathway primarily sustains the future amoc, their magnitudes are directly proportional in both 4xco2 (r = 0.99; fig. 4a) and u03_hos (r = 0.93; fig. 4d), excluding 4 outlying models in 4xco2 (shaded orange in fig. 4a). these four models have anomalously strong future amocs owing to notable atlantic or indo-pacific residual upwelling pathways (fig. 2a\u2013d). these upwelling pathways are unrealistically large in the control simulations relative to the observed amoc strength (fig. 2b,d) or they have anomalously weak decreases in the future state (fig. 2b,d, brown triangles).\nin ref. 3, we showed that in a transient state, changes in amoc strength are balanced by changes in the amoc\u2019s upwelling pathways, and vice versa. these changes are communicated rapidly by non-advective wave processes31, ensuring a global upwelling\u2013downwelling balance to conserve volume. thus, on a decadal or longer timescale, the time-mean amoc upwelling pathways are equal to the time-mean amoc strength (fig. 2). changes in the meridional overturning circulation remote from, but connected to, the north atlantic through the overturning streamfunction therefore modulate the amoc strength, even if the amoc weakening is instigated by changes in north atlantic forcing.\nas they cannot bypass the pmoc. this scenario occurs in the future state of all models with a pmoc (extended data figs. 2 and 3), ensuring that indopac_residualup is zero (fig. 2d,h). if southernocean_ up, calculated from the first expression on the right-hand side of equation (3), exceeds the amoc transport into the so (amocmin; grey circle in extended data fig. 10), we adjust southernocean_up to match amocmin (second expression on the right-hand side of equation (3)). this ensures that the amoc\u2019s so upwelling pathway is not stronger than the amoc transport into the so, as required by conservation of volume. we therefore implicitly account for the impact of the pmoc on the amoc\u2019s so upwelling pathway in this case, based on conservation of volume. we account for the pmoc implicitly rather than explicitly to prevent inaccuracies in the upwelling pathways that would otherwise occur in the following scenarios. 1. if the pmoc maximum is below z_amoc_34s, then amoc deep waters\nour approach is validated by indopac_residualup tending rapidly (over several decades) towards zero (fig. 2d,h) before we constrain it to zero by setting southernocean_up to amocmin (second expression on the right-hand side of equation (3)). the pmoc rapidly expands, preventing upwelling above the pmoc\u2019s base. therefore, indopac_ residualup quickly tends to zero when a pmoc forms. our approach is further validated by the strong correlation between the inverse future pmoc strength and the change in the amoc\u2019s so upwelling pathway (fig. 4a,c), despite our approach not explicitly accounting for the pmoc in the future-state calculations (when southernocean_up is set to amocmin). the outlying cesm2-based models in fig. 4c,f and fig. 5b,d (purple shading) emphasize the importance of implicitly accounting for the pmoc in the future state to prevent inaccuracies in the magnitude of southernocean_up (see scenario 1 above). we further validated our method by examining the overturning streamfunctions across models and experiments for inconsistencies with their calculated upwelling pathways.",

        "context": "the interpretation that the globally observed tsunami was of atmospheric origin and driven by acoustic-gravity waves is quantitatively supported by a tsunami numerical model forced by a moving air-pressure disturbance. critically, this model\u2014which is based on a finite volume method solver of the non-linear shallow-water equations equipped with air-pressure forcing terms (methods and extended data fig. 5)\u2014is able to reproduce the tsunami\u2019s fast propagation (fig. 3a), long duration (fig. 3b and supplementary information video 2) and global reach (fig. 3c and supplementary information video 2). the model also closely reproduces the arrival time observations (fig. 3a and extended data fig. 1), in stark contrast to the point-sourced tsunami propagation, which fails to explain the early arrival of the first tsunami waves (extended data fig. 1). moreover, it provides a valid mechanism to explain the interoceanic wave propagation, showing that waves were rapidly generated across the oceans, giving the impression that these waves \u2018jump\u2019 from one ocean to another (for example, from the pacific to the atlantic oceans across central america) with a minimal\nloss of wave height (fig. 3b and supplementary information video 2). a simulation covering 36 h of temporal propagation (supplementary information video 2) shows that at each passage of the air-pressure disturbance\u2014in the direction away from or back to the source\u2014the ocean surface is further excited and new waves are generated (fig. 3b), explaining the long duration of the observed tsunami. the model also explains how the atmospheric-driven tsunami amplifies through a resonance mechanism, leading to localized sizeable waves in areas adjacent to the deep-water oceanic trenches (fig. 3c). it closely reproduces, at many open-ocean locations, both the observed maximum wave amplitudes (fig. 3d) and the recorded time series (extended data fig. 6), but with certain discrepancies (methods). ultimately, the simulated global distribution of the tsunami maximum wave amplitudes shows minimal interoceanic wave dissipation, as is particularly noticeable in the atlantic ocean (fig. 3d).\nsubsequent main envelope of the acoustic-gravity wave interacts with the first tsunami wave train (methods and extended data figs. 7 and 8), resulting in an air\u2013water energy transfer that leads to an increase in tsunami wave amplitudes (extended data fig. 8). for sinusoidal waves of identical wavelength and frequency, almost all of the initial energy can be transferred between the two types of waves, whereas for wave packets, the interaction becomes less efficient, with only up to 40% of the initial energy being transferred19. the generated tsunami can also amplify under proudman resonance30, when the acoustic-gravity wave speed matches the speed of the ocean long waves in very deep water, leading to higher-amplitude waves (fig. 3c) that propagate under gravity towards the coast, that is, explaining the second tsunami wave train of later arrival (fig. 3b), as recorded around the world by around 100 coastal stations, among those here analysed. this resonance mechanism is, however, not expected in shallow waters, given that tsunami waves become slower and do not resonate with acoustic-gravity waves in these areas (fig. 3c), thus explaining why land masses surrounded by wide and shallow continental shelves did not experience sizeable (or, in some cases, even noticeable) tsunami amplitudes. crucially, the highest tsunami amplitudes and runup heights are expected along land masses that rise abruptly from the abyssal plains or oceanic trenches, as occurs at oceanic islands and coastlines adjacent to subduction zones. in these settings, the amplification of the resonant tsunami waves with acoustic-gravity waves is maximized and minimally attenuated before impact ashore. this explains why notable tsunami amplitudes were recorded at distant coasts such as japan (about 1 m) and along the western margin of south america (about 1.43 m in chile) (fig. 2b and supplementary information table 1). in ocean basins, comprising both shallow and deep waters such as in the caribbean and the mediterranean, tsunami amplification is believed to occur in deep-water areas, as shown by the numerical model (fig. 3c,d), and then the amplified waves propagate towards the shallow-water coastal areas, reaching around 20\u201350 cm at some locations (fig. 2b and supplementary information table 1). atmospheric-driven tsunamis of volcanic origin are, thus, different from earthquake-triggered and point-sourced tsunamis in terms of generation, propagation and impact, with clear hazard implications: they travel much faster, experience minimal energy dissipation as a function of increasing distance, can reach the size of earthquake-triggered tsunamis as enough energy gets pumped into them and tend to pose a much larger threat to land masses that rise abruptly from the deep ocean, in a clear contrast to latter tsunamis that amplify in shallow-water areas.\nin summary, our data analysis (figs. 1 and 2 and extended

        "context": "the interpretation that the globally observed tsunami was of atmospheric origin and driven by acoustic-gravity waves is quantitatively supported by a tsunami numerical model forced by a moving air-pressure disturbance. critically, this model\u2014which is based on a finite volume method solver of the non-linear shallow-water equations equipped with air-pressure forcing terms (methods and extended data fig. 5)\u2014is able to reproduce the tsunami\u2019s fast propagation (fig. 3a), long duration (fig. 3b and supplementary information video 2) and global reach (fig. 3c and supplementary information video 2). the model also closely reproduces the arrival time observations (fig. 3a and extended data fig. 1), in stark contrast to the point-sourced tsunami propagation, which fails to explain the early arrival of the first tsunami waves (extended data fig. 1). moreover, it provides a valid mechanism to explain the interoceanic wave propagation, showing that waves were rapidly generated across the oceans, giving the impression that these waves \u2018jump\u2019 from one ocean to another (for example, from the pacific to the atlantic oceans across central america) with a minimal\nloss of wave height (fig. 3b and supplementary information video 2). a simulation covering 36 h of temporal propagation (supplementary information video 2) shows that at each passage of the air-pressure disturbance\u2014in the direction away from or back to the source\u2014the ocean surface is further excited and new waves are generated (fig. 3b), explaining the long duration of the observed tsunami. the model also explains how the atmospheric-driven tsunami amplifies through a resonance mechanism, leading to localized sizeable waves in areas adjacent to the deep-water oceanic trenches (fig. 3c). it closely reproduces, at many open-ocean locations, both the observed maximum wave amplitudes (fig. 3d) and the recorded time series (extended data fig. 6), but with certain discrepancies (methods). ultimately, the simulated global distribution of the tsunami maximum wave amplitudes shows minimal interoceanic wave dissipation, as is particularly noticeable in the atlantic ocean (fig. 3d).\nsubsequent main envelope of the acoustic-gravity wave interacts with the first tsunami wave train (methods and extended data figs. 7 and 8), resulting in an air\u2013water energy transfer that leads to an increase in tsunami wave amplitudes (extended data fig. 8). for sinusoidal waves of identical wavelength and frequency, almost all of the initial energy can be transferred between the two types of waves, whereas for wave packets, the interaction becomes less efficient, with only up to 40% of the initial energy being transferred19. the generated tsunami can also amplify under proudman resonance30, when the acoustic-gravity wave speed matches the speed of the ocean long waves in very deep water, leading to higher-amplitude waves (fig. 3c) that propagate under gravity towards the coast, that is, explaining the second tsunami wave train of later arrival (fig. 3b), as recorded around the world by around 100 coastal stations, among those here analysed. this resonance mechanism is, however, not expected in shallow waters, given that tsunami waves become slower and do not resonate with acoustic-gravity waves in these areas (fig. 3c), thus explaining why land masses surrounded by wide and shallow continental shelves did not experience sizeable (or, in some cases, even noticeable) tsunami amplitudes. crucially, the highest tsunami amplitudes and runup heights are expected along land masses that rise abruptly from the abyssal plains or oceanic trenches, as occurs at oceanic islands and coastlines adjacent to subduction zones. in these settings, the amplification of the resonant tsunami waves with acoustic-gravity waves is maximized and minimally attenuated before impact ashore. this explains why notable tsunami amplitudes were recorded at distant coasts such as japan (about 1 m) and along the western margin of south america (about 1.43 m in chile) (fig. 2b and supplementary information table 1). in ocean basins, comprising both shallow and deep waters such as in the caribbean and the mediterranean, tsunami amplification is believed to occur in deep-water areas, as shown by the numerical model (fig. 3c,d), and then the amplified waves propagate towards the shallow-water coastal areas, reaching around 20\u201350 cm at some locations (fig. 2b and supplementary information table 1). atmospheric-driven tsunamis of volcanic origin are, thus, different from earthquake-triggered and point-sourced tsunamis in terms of generation, propagation and impact, with clear hazard implications: they travel much faster, experience minimal energy dissipation as a function of increasing distance, can reach the size of earthquake-triggered tsunamis as enough energy gets pumped into them and tend to pose a much larger threat to land masses that rise abruptly from the deep ocean, in a clear contrast to latter tsunamis that amplify in shallow-water areas.\nin summary, our data analysis (figs. 1 and 2 and extended

        "context": "simulated enso variability since last glacial maximum our simulations show that the enso phenomenon can experience pronounced changes over a wide range of past and future climate states. overall levels of enso variability increase under greenhouse warming and decrease under glacial conditions (fig. 1a, bars). these changes\u2014quantified by the standard deviation of sst variability over the nin\u0303o\u20133.4 region\u2014are sufficiently large relative to unforced levels of variability (fig. 1a, whiskers) and can, therefore, be used for validation against palaeoclimate reconstructions. simulated enso variability reaches its lowest intensity under glacial and deglacial conditions, followed by a rapid increase to near-modern levels of variability as the climate responds to interglacial conditions (fig. 1a). the simulated enso variability shows a weaker upward trend under holocene\nconditions, reaching the maximum amplitude for modern, preindustrial conditions (fig. 1a, 0 ka bp interval). greenhouse warming results in a pronounced increase in enso variability comparable to but not as large as the reductions under glacial conditions.\nthe broad levels of enso variability simulated in each climatic state are directly linked to the frequency of extreme el nin\u0303o. in climates with higher enso variability, sst variability has a distribution with heavier, not longer, tails (fig. 1b). this indicates that extreme el nin\u0303o events become more frequent, but their maximum amplitude does not change. under greenhouse warming, the mean amplitude of extreme el nin\u0303o, defined as events with peak amplitude larger than 2 k, decreases slightly (fig. 1b). our simulations show that the overall levels of enso variability are governed by how often extreme el nin\u0303o events are triggered. the lowest levels of enso variability occur in intervals with no (or very few) extreme el nin\u0303o events (for example, 15 ka bp) relative to preindustrial conditions. conversely, the highest variability occurs in response to greenhouse warming, with one in two events reaching extreme amplitude. the frequency of occurrence of extreme el nin\u0303o and overall enso variability are highly correlated across all simulations (r = 0.98, p-value < 0.01; fig. 1d), indicating that this relationship is independent of the type of forcing.\nthe magnitude of the simulated glacial\u2013interglacial changes is much larger than that for other intervals and, therefore, potentially detectable using reconstructions of past enso variability. by contrast, the increase in enso variability in response to changing holocene forcings is much weaker and detectable only because of the length of our simulations. this forced trend is overwhelmed by unforced variability\u2014with a wide range of values of enso amplitude simulated over 100-year periods (fig. 1a, error bars). this response is consistent with the palaeoclimate records derived from fossil corals and bivalves, suggesting a highly variable enso phenomenon during this interval3,20,21 and, therefore, limited detectability of forced changes using available palaeodata22. accordingly, owing to the availability of multiple ifa reconstructions and the large, therefore detectable, simulated changes, we focus our investigation on the last glacial maximum (lgm)\u2014the interval 21 ka bp, when ice sheets reached their maximum extent and co2 concentrations were low (about 180 ppm). this analysis excludes the influence of freshwater forcing, which potentially drove changes in enso during deglacial intervals14,23,24. however, the paucity of a well-dated coverage of ifa records during these intervals prevents robust attribution of changes compared with using ifa data from the lgm.\nfrom the central equatorial pacific site and existing data from odp site 849 in the eastern equatorial pacific show unambiguous evidence of externally forced reductions in enso variability (figs. 2 and 3 and methods). the distributions of anomalies for both the late holocene baseline and the lgm show distinct agreement with simulated variability at both sites (compare fig. 3a\u2013d with fig. 1b). both sites show pronounced glacial reductions in the tails of the distributions, particularly the warm ones (figs. 1b and 3g\u2013h). this indicates that extreme el nin\u0303o and, to a lesser degree, la nin\u0303a were less frequent during the lgm. statistical resampling of simulated temperature variability at species-specific depths shows low probabilities (\u226516%) that ifa changes at these sites arose from unforced variability or because of changes in seasonality (fig. 3e,f, red lines compared with green distributions). that is, each site shows a high probability (84% and 88%, respectively) that the ifa changes reflect externally forced changes in enso. together, the ifa changes show a \u226598% joint probability of externally forced reductions in enso variability during the lgm. moreover, reductions in the warmest quantiles of glacial ifa anomalies relative to late holocene values (fig. 3g,h) suggest that extreme el nin\u0303o events were suppressed under lgm conditions, in line with the proposed mechanism.\npacific ocean mean state at 21 ka the main text demonstrates model\u2013data parity between reconstructed and simulated ocean temperature variability in the surface and subsurface pacific ocean under lgm boundary conditions using cesm1.2 and ifa. additional assessments of the 21 ka simulation are previously published53,57; ref. 53 also validated simulated lgm patterns in the indo-pacific using a network of mean annual temperature proxies. however, assessments of the pattern and magnitude of mean annual temperature changes across the pacific ocean are more challenging because of both larger gaps in the proxy record43 owing to the size of the basin and large multiproxy uncertainty arising from conflicting proxy reconstructions42,43,70. furthermore, seasonal and depth-related biases in different proxies71\u2014including their stationarity72\u2014in tandem with calibration uncertainties73,74 complicate estimates of mean sst change. recent applications of palaeoclimate data assimilation techniques have made marked advances in circumventing the aforementioned biases by explicitly incorporating proxy system models to blend model output and palaeoproxy information43. moreover, data assimilation techniques provide globally complete reconstructions by leveraging local and remote information arising from available proxies. a recent assessment of four independent palaeoclimate assimilation reconstructions of the lgm (using both inverse and forward modelling of proxies) indicates that ssts in the eastern tropical pacific cooled more than the western pacific44 after accounting for proxy and spatial biases. this inference (see multimodel mean in fig. 1e in ref. 44) is in striking agreement with the simulated pattern and magnitude of surface-ocean cooling in our simulations. in cesm1.2, the eastern equatorial pacific cooling response is associated with a deeper thermocline during the lgm57 (fig. 4). whereas available estimates of changes in lgm thermocline depths have also been largely equivocal40,75,76, recent reappraisals of proxy data in the eastern39 and western41 tropical pacific strongly support a deeper thermocline. moreover, cesm1.2 shows thermocline deepening in the southern tropical western pacific41 and shoaling in the off-equatorial northern tropical pacific and in the southwest pacific (see fig. 8a in ref. 57), both features that are observed in proxy reconstructions40,41,75,76. accordingly, we suggest that these lines of evidence point to a thicker mixed layer across the pacific40 during the lgm, with a more substantial deepening of the thermocline in the eastern equatorial pacific39, pointing towards a stronger walker circulation26, as observed in the cesm1.2. simulations.\nextended data fig. 2 | atmospheric damping and enso variability under preindustrial, 2xco2, and 4xco2 forcing. a. rates of atmospheric damping of el nin\u0303o events across climatic states considered in this study. b. & c. enso variability and frequency distribution of simulated nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst anomalies under preindustrial (pi), 2xco2, and 4xco2 forcings (both computed as in fig. 1). d. growth and damping rates associated with the bjerknes feedback and atmospheric damping under pi, 2xco2, and 4xco2 forcings. e. simulated ssts along the equatorial pacific (5\u00b0 s\u20135\u00b0 n) for climatological (annual mean) and el nin\u0303o conditions under pi, 2xco2, and 4xco2 forcings. el nin\u0303o conditions are averaged from november to january for events with nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst index larger than 2 k. observed ssts (black curves) are from ersst5 (years 1854 to 2022). equatorial ssts are averaged over the 5\u00b0 s\u20135\u00b0 n latitude range. warm pool temperatures (dotted lines) are the equatorial (5\u00b0 s\u20135\u00b0 n) average from 120\u00b0 e to 150\u00b0 e.",

        "context": "simulated enso variability since last glacial maximum our simulations show that the enso phenomenon can experience pronounced changes over a wide range of past and future climate states. overall levels of enso variability increase under greenhouse warming and decrease under glacial conditions (fig. 1a, bars). these changes\u2014quantified by the standard deviation of sst variability over the nin\u0303o\u20133.4 region\u2014are sufficiently large relative to unforced levels of variability (fig. 1a, whiskers) and can, therefore, be used for validation against palaeoclimate reconstructions. simulated enso variability reaches its lowest intensity under glacial and deglacial conditions, followed by a rapid increase to near-modern levels of variability as the climate responds to interglacial conditions (fig. 1a). the simulated enso variability shows a weaker upward trend under holocene\nconditions, reaching the maximum amplitude for modern, preindustrial conditions (fig. 1a, 0 ka bp interval). greenhouse warming results in a pronounced increase in enso variability comparable to but not as large as the reductions under glacial conditions.\nthe broad levels of enso variability simulated in each climatic state are directly linked to the frequency of extreme el nin\u0303o. in climates with higher enso variability, sst variability has a distribution with heavier, not longer, tails (fig. 1b). this indicates that extreme el nin\u0303o events become more frequent, but their maximum amplitude does not change. under greenhouse warming, the mean amplitude of extreme el nin\u0303o, defined as events with peak amplitude larger than 2 k, decreases slightly (fig. 1b). our simulations show that the overall levels of enso variability are governed by how often extreme el nin\u0303o events are triggered. the lowest levels of enso variability occur in intervals with no (or very few) extreme el nin\u0303o events (for example, 15 ka bp) relative to preindustrial conditions. conversely, the highest variability occurs in response to greenhouse warming, with one in two events reaching extreme amplitude. the frequency of occurrence of extreme el nin\u0303o and overall enso variability are highly correlated across all simulations (r = 0.98, p-value < 0.01; fig. 1d), indicating that this relationship is independent of the type of forcing.\nthe magnitude of the simulated glacial\u2013interglacial changes is much larger than that for other intervals and, therefore, potentially detectable using reconstructions of past enso variability. by contrast, the increase in enso variability in response to changing holocene forcings is much weaker and detectable only because of the length of our simulations. this forced trend is overwhelmed by unforced variability\u2014with a wide range of values of enso amplitude simulated over 100-year periods (fig. 1a, error bars). this response is consistent with the palaeoclimate records derived from fossil corals and bivalves, suggesting a highly variable enso phenomenon during this interval3,20,21 and, therefore, limited detectability of forced changes using available palaeodata22. accordingly, owing to the availability of multiple ifa reconstructions and the large, therefore detectable, simulated changes, we focus our investigation on the last glacial maximum (lgm)\u2014the interval 21 ka bp, when ice sheets reached their maximum extent and co2 concentrations were low (about 180 ppm). this analysis excludes the influence of freshwater forcing, which potentially drove changes in enso during deglacial intervals14,23,24. however, the paucity of a well-dated coverage of ifa records during these intervals prevents robust attribution of changes compared with using ifa data from the lgm.\nfrom the central equatorial pacific site and existing data from odp site 849 in the eastern equatorial pacific show unambiguous evidence of externally forced reductions in enso variability (figs. 2 and 3 and methods). the distributions of anomalies for both the late holocene baseline and the lgm show distinct agreement with simulated variability at both sites (compare fig. 3a\u2013d with fig. 1b). both sites show pronounced glacial reductions in the tails of the distributions, particularly the warm ones (figs. 1b and 3g\u2013h). this indicates that extreme el nin\u0303o and, to a lesser degree, la nin\u0303a were less frequent during the lgm. statistical resampling of simulated temperature variability at species-specific depths shows low probabilities (\u226516%) that ifa changes at these sites arose from unforced variability or because of changes in seasonality (fig. 3e,f, red lines compared with green distributions). that is, each site shows a high probability (84% and 88%, respectively) that the ifa changes reflect externally forced changes in enso. together, the ifa changes show a \u226598% joint probability of externally forced reductions in enso variability during the lgm. moreover, reductions in the warmest quantiles of glacial ifa anomalies relative to late holocene values (fig. 3g,h) suggest that extreme el nin\u0303o events were suppressed under lgm conditions, in line with the proposed mechanism.\npacific ocean mean state at 21 ka the main text demonstrates model\u2013data parity between reconstructed and simulated ocean temperature variability in the surface and subsurface pacific ocean under lgm boundary conditions using cesm1.2 and ifa. additional assessments of the 21 ka simulation are previously published53,57; ref. 53 also validated simulated lgm patterns in the indo-pacific using a network of mean annual temperature proxies. however, assessments of the pattern and magnitude of mean annual temperature changes across the pacific ocean are more challenging because of both larger gaps in the proxy record43 owing to the size of the basin and large multiproxy uncertainty arising from conflicting proxy reconstructions42,43,70. furthermore, seasonal and depth-related biases in different proxies71\u2014including their stationarity72\u2014in tandem with calibration uncertainties73,74 complicate estimates of mean sst change. recent applications of palaeoclimate data assimilation techniques have made marked advances in circumventing the aforementioned biases by explicitly incorporating proxy system models to blend model output and palaeoproxy information43. moreover, data assimilation techniques provide globally complete reconstructions by leveraging local and remote information arising from available proxies. a recent assessment of four independent palaeoclimate assimilation reconstructions of the lgm (using both inverse and forward modelling of proxies) indicates that ssts in the eastern tropical pacific cooled more than the western pacific44 after accounting for proxy and spatial biases. this inference (see multimodel mean in fig. 1e in ref. 44) is in striking agreement with the simulated pattern and magnitude of surface-ocean cooling in our simulations. in cesm1.2, the eastern equatorial pacific cooling response is associated with a deeper thermocline during the lgm57 (fig. 4). whereas available estimates of changes in lgm thermocline depths have also been largely equivocal40,75,76, recent reappraisals of proxy data in the eastern39 and western41 tropical pacific strongly support a deeper thermocline. moreover, cesm1.2 shows thermocline deepening in the southern tropical western pacific41 and shoaling in the off-equatorial northern tropical pacific and in the southwest pacific (see fig. 8a in ref. 57), both features that are observed in proxy reconstructions40,41,75,76. accordingly, we suggest that these lines of evidence point to a thicker mixed layer across the pacific40 during the lgm, with a more substantial deepening of the thermocline in the eastern equatorial pacific39, pointing towards a stronger walker circulation26, as observed in the cesm1.2. simulations.\nextended data fig. 2 | atmospheric damping and enso variability under preindustrial, 2xco2, and 4xco2 forcing. a. rates of atmospheric damping of el nin\u0303o events across climatic states considered in this study. b. & c. enso variability and frequency distribution of simulated nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst anomalies under preindustrial (pi), 2xco2, and 4xco2 forcings (both computed as in fig. 1). d. growth and damping rates associated with the bjerknes feedback and atmospheric damping under pi, 2xco2, and 4xco2 forcings. e. simulated ssts along the equatorial pacific (5\u00b0 s\u20135\u00b0 n) for climatological (annual mean) and el nin\u0303o conditions under pi, 2xco2, and 4xco2 forcings. el nin\u0303o conditions are averaged from november to january for events with nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst index larger than 2 k. observed ssts (black curves) are from ersst5 (years 1854 to 2022). equatorial ssts are averaged over the 5\u00b0 s\u20135\u00b0 n latitude range. warm pool temperatures (dotted lines) are the equatorial (5\u00b0 s\u20135\u00b0 n) average from 120\u00b0 e to 150\u00b0 e.",

fig. 1d), indicating that this relationship is independent of the type of forcing.\nthe magnitude of the simulated glacial\u2013interglacial changes is much larger than that for other intervals and, therefore, potentially detectable using reconstructions of past enso variability. by contrast, the increase in enso variability in response to changing holocene forcings is much weaker and detectable only because of the length of our simulations. this forced trend is overwhelmed by unforced variability\u2014with a wide range of values of enso amplitude simulated over 100-year periods (fig. 1a, error bars). this response is consistent with the palaeoclimate records derived from fossil corals and bivalves, suggesting a highly variable enso phenomenon during this interval3,20,21 and, therefore, limited detectability of forced changes using available palaeodata22. accordingly, owing to the availability of multiple ifa reconstructions and the large, therefore detectable, simulated changes, we focus our investigation on the last glacial maximum (lgm)\u2014the interval 21 ka bp, when ice sheets reached their maximum extent and co2 concentrations were low (about 180 ppm). this analysis excludes the influence of freshwater forcing, which potentially drove changes in enso during deglacial intervals14,23,24. however, the paucity of a well-dated coverage of ifa records during these intervals prevents robust attribution of changes compared with using ifa data from the lgm.\nfrom the central equatorial pacific site and existing data from odp site 849 in the eastern equatorial pacific show unambiguous evidence of externally forced reductions in enso variability (figs. 2 and 3 and methods). the distributions of anomalies for both the late holocene baseline and the lgm show distinct agreement with simulated variability at both sites (compare fig. 3a\u2013d with fig. 1b). both sites show pronounced glacial reductions in the tails of the distributions, particularly the warm ones (figs. 1b and 3g\u2013h). this indicates that extreme el nin\u0303o and, to a lesser degree, la nin\u0303a were less frequent during the lgm. statistical resampling of simulated temperature variability at species-specific depths shows low probabilities (\u226516%) that ifa changes at these sites arose from unforced variability or because of changes in seasonality (fig. 3e,f, red lines compared with green distributions). that is, each site shows a high probability (84% and 88%, respectively) that the ifa changes reflect externally forced changes in enso. together, the ifa changes show a \u226598% joint probability of externally forced reductions in enso variability during the lgm. moreover, reductions in the warmest quantiles of glacial ifa anomalies relative to late holocene values (fig. 3g,h) suggest that extreme el nin\u0303o events were suppressed under lgm conditions, in line with the proposed mechanism.\npacific ocean mean state at 21 ka the main text demonstrates model\u2013data parity between reconstructed and simulated ocean temperature variability in the surface and subsurface pacific ocean under lgm boundary conditions using cesm1.2 and ifa. additional assessments of the 21 ka simulation are previously published53,57; ref. 53 also validated simulated lgm patterns in the indo-pacific using a network of mean annual temperature proxies. however, assessments of the pattern and magnitude of mean annual temperature changes across the pacific ocean are more challenging because of both larger gaps in the proxy record43 owing to the size of the basin and large multiproxy uncertainty arising from conflicting proxy reconstructions42,43,70. furthermore, seasonal and depth-related biases in different proxies71\u2014including their stationarity72\u2014in tandem with calibration uncertainties73,74 complicate estimates of mean sst change. recent applications of palaeoclimate data assimilation techniques have made marked advances in circumventing the aforementioned biases by explicitly incorporating proxy system models to blend model output and palaeoproxy information43. moreover, data assimilation techniques provide globally complete reconstructions by leveraging local and remote information arising from available proxies. a recent assessment of four independent palaeoclimate assimilation reconstructions of the lgm (using both inverse and forward modelling of proxies) indicates that ssts in the eastern tropical pacific cooled more than the western pacific44 after accounting for proxy and spatial biases. this inference (see multimodel mean in fig. 1e in ref. 44) is in striking agreement with the simulated pattern and magnitude of surface-ocean cooling in our simulations. in cesm1.2, the eastern equatorial pacific cooling response is associated with a deeper thermocline during the lgm57 (fig. 4). whereas available estimates of changes in lgm thermocline depths have also been largely equivocal40,75,76, recent reappraisals of proxy data in the eastern39 and western41 tropical pacific strongly support a deeper thermocline. moreover, cesm1.2 shows thermocline deepening in the southern tropical western pacific41 and shoaling in the off-equatorial northern tropical pacific and in the southwest pacific (see fig. 8a in ref. 57), both features that are observed in proxy reconstructions40,41,75,76. accordingly, we suggest that these lines of evidence point to a thicker mixed layer across the pacific40 during the lgm, with a more substantial deepening of the thermocline in the eastern equatorial pacific39, pointing towards a stronger walker circulation26, as observed in the cesm1.2. simulations.\nextended data fig. 2 | atmospheric damping and enso variability under preindustrial, 2xco2, and 4xco2 forcing. a. rates of atmospheric damping of el nin\u0303o events across climatic states considered in this study. b. & c. enso variability and frequency distribution of simulated nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst anomalies under preindustrial (pi), 2xco2, and 4xco2 forcings (both computed as in fig. 1). d. growth and damping rates associated with the bjerknes feedback and atmospheric damping under pi, 2xco2, and 4xco2 forcings. e. simulated ssts along the equatorial pacific (5\u00b0 s\u20135\u00b0 n) for climatological (annual mean) and el nin\u0303o conditions under pi, 2xco2, and 4xco2 forcings. el nin\u0303o conditions are averaged from november to january for events with nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst index larger than 2 k. observed ssts (black curves) are from ersst5 (years 1854 to 2022). equatorial ssts are averaged over the 5\u00b0 s\u20135\u00b0 n latitude range. warm pool temperatures (dotted lines) are the equatorial (5\u00b0 s\u20135\u00b0 n) average from 120\u00b0 e to 150\u00b0 e.",

        "context": "changes in temperature variability during the lgm show striking agreement with our simulation. depth-stratified estimates of simulated changes in temperature variability between the lgm and preindustrial simulation show how the different sites capture interannual versus seasonal variability (fig. 2, hatching, and extended data fig. 1). new data\nsimulated changes in temperature variability between the 21 ka bp and 0 ka bp timeslices were compared relative to reconstructed changes using ifa from lgm and late holocene sediments. the intervals corresponding to deglacial conditions (18 ka, 15 ka and 12 ka) exhibit the largest simulated changes due to a combination of glacial and orbital forcings, but there are few-to-no palaeoreconstructions of enso variability from these intervals without an influence from freshwater forcing14,24,66 and its influence on the amoc. there is a wealth of coral and mollusc records of palaeo-enso variability from the holocene20\u201322, but the model and data evidence point to changes dominated by natural multi-decadal to longer variations in levels of enso variability. the ifa reconstructions span multiple sites and depths at which seasonal to interannual processes are dynamically heterogeneous and capture unique aspects of glacial and modern el nin\u0303o variability and extremes (fig. 2). simulated ocean temperatures at the grid-point location of the core were used to compare temperature variability derived from surface-ocean ifa. specific depth ranges were chosen for comparison based on recent global core-top estimates of apparent calcification depths25,67 (extended data fig. 1). changes in temperature variability using depth-stratified averages of 0\u201330 m, 40\u201380 m and 100\u2013150 m were calculated in the simulations to compare with globigerinoides ruber, trilobatus sacculifer and neogloboquadrina dutertrei, and globorotalia tumida, respectively (fig. 2). we further investigated site-based model\u2013data responses at two locations at which the simulated signal of enso-driven changes relative to the calcification depth of foraminifera (and associated uncertainty; see extended data fig. 1) was unambiguous: our central equatorial pacific site ml2108-21mc/20bb and iodp site 849 in the eastern equatorial pacific12. at each site, the distributions of simulated variability were computed in the following scenarios: (1) changes between the 0 ka and 21 ka simulation (purple distribution and quantile\u2013quantile uncertainty envelope in fig. 3) and (2) seasonal variability under 21 ka conditions imposed with interannual anomalies from the 0 ka simulation (green distribution and quantile envelope in fig. 3). these scenarios provide a statistical null hypothesis in which the ifa-inferred changes in variability may arise from changes in the local annual cycle. bootstrap monte carlo simulations (n = 10,000) were performed for each scenario resampling the simulated variability according to the number of ifa samples generated by each study for the late holocene and lgm datasets (extended data table 3). analytical uncertainty (1\u03c3) values of 0.1\u2030 (ml1208) and 0.15 mmol mol\u22121 (odp site 849) were incorporated into each realization. finally, we computed the probability that each scenario explains the ifa-inferred changes in variability at each site (as % change; fig. 3).",

        "context": "our simulations show that the strength of the bjerknes feedback in each climate state is correlated with the fraction of el nin\u0303o events that reach extreme amplitude (\u22652 k; ref. 7). warmer climates show the strongest growth rate of simulated sst anomalies in the central pacific, particularly during boreal summer when el nin\u0303o events develop (fig. 4a). by contrast, these growth rates are negligible under glacial conditions. their summertime magnitude\u2014the strength of the bjerknes feedback\u2014is highly correlated (r = 0.98, p-value < 10\u22126) with the mean amplitude of el nin\u0303o events in each climatic state (fig. 4b). this relationship supports a causal link between the changes in the strength of the bjerknes feedback and the frequency of el nin\u0303o events that reach extreme amplitude. the higher growth rates during boreal summer are consistent with the notion that stochastic wind variability during this season has the largest impact on the amplitude of extreme el nin\u0303o28.\nextreme el nin\u0303o events are not very frequent under preindustrial conditions because sustained levels of wind fluctuations are required to activate the bjerknes feedback28. under glacial conditions, the bjerknes feedback is very weak (fig. 4b) and thus rarely activated. as a result, the frequency of extreme el nin\u0303o decreases to less than 20% compared with preindustrial levels. by contrast, under greenhouse warming, a stronger bjerknes feedback is more easily activated. as a result, more than 50% of simulated el nin\u0303o events reach extreme amplitude. the fact that enso variability does not vanish when the bjerknes feedback is very weak or negligible (for example, 12 ka bp, 15 ka bp and 18 ka bp intervals) indicates that all simulations have sufficient levels of stochastic variability controlled by other processes operating in the climate system.\nto determine how changes in the climate of the tropical pacific alter the frequency of extreme el nin\u0303o, we quantified the strength of coupled processes involved in the bjerknes feedback. we find that mechanical coupling between winds and ocean currents is the dominant physical process driving changes in growth rates associated with this positive feedback (fig. 4c, magenta curve compared with black curve; see the methods for details). this mechanical coupling of currents and winds is the weakest under glacial conditions, with reductions of up to 60%, and the strongest under greenhouse warming, increasing by more than 70%, relative to pi conditions (fig. 4c). low mechanical coupling under glacial conditions hinders the eastward expansion of the warm pool during the onset of el nin\u0303o and explains why fewer events reach peak amplitude. conversely, high mechanical coupling under greenhouse warming favours the eastward expansion of the warm pool and the activation of the bjerknes feedback. the responsiveness of winds to sst anomalies also plays an important part in the strength of the bjerknes feedback. this wind\u2013sst coupling is also weaker under glacial conditions and stronger under greenhouse warming (fig. 4c, blue curve). together, these two coupled processes explain most of the changes in the strength of the bjerknes feedback across climatic states (fig. 4c, black curve). the bjerknes feedback is also controlled by the magnitude of the climatological sst contrast across the equatorial pacific because this gradient governs the thermal advection by anomalous currents. this thermal coupling is stronger under glacial conditions and weaker under interglacial conditions (fig. 4c, green curve) and, therefore, cannot explain the simulated pattern of changes in extreme el nin\u0303o.\nthe strength of the coupling mechanisms, and, therefore, the frequency of extreme el nin\u0303o events across cold and warm climates, is ultimately tied to the strength of the pacific walker circulation. this influence is mediated by the changes in the depth of the oceanic mixed layer and the climatological extent of the warm pool. warmer climates are characterized by a weaker walker circulation, shallow oceanic mixed layer and an eastward expanded warm pool, whereas the opposite occurs for glacial climates (fig. 4d). in warmer climates, wind fluctuations transfer momentum to a thinner layer of upper ocean waters making zonal currents more responsive to wind variations during the onset of el nin\u0303o. moreover, winds are more responsive to sst anomalies because an eastward expanded warm pool favours convection over a larger area along the equatorial pacific. both factors promote rapid expansions of the warm pool during the onset of el nin\u0303o, allowing more events to reach extreme amplitude (fig. 5). the opposite scenario occurs under glacial conditions, in which the onset of extreme el nin\u0303o is hindered by less responsive ocean currents and winds because of a deeper mixed layer and a contracted warm pool\u2014both driven by a stronger walker circulation (fig. 5).\nthe anomalous temperature tendency because of thermal advection by zonal currents is positively correlated with positive sst anomalies in the equatorial nin\u0303o\u20133.4 region, consistent with a positive bjerknes feedback. this relationship indicates that during growing el nin\u0303o events, zonal currents weaken driven by the weakening trade winds, reducing the climatological cooling at the edge of the warm pool. this response translates into a warming of the central equatorial pacific driving a further weakening of the trade winds and equatorial currents, feeding back into the expanding warm pool during the growth of an el nin\u0303o event. partial least-square regression was used to compute the slope between the positive temperature tendency associated with the zonal thermal advection and the positive equatorial nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst anomaly. this slope represents the growth rate of sst anomalies in the central equatorial pacific driven by zonal thermal advection associated with the expansion of the warm pool. this growth rate is the main process contributing to the bjerknes feedback and reaches the peak amplitude during boreal summer when el nin\u0303o events grow (fig. 4a). the strength of the bjerknes feedback (fig. 4b) is computed using the slope of those same quantities (zonal thermal advection versus the positive nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst anomaly), but averaged from june to september before computing the slope. damping rates associated with air\u2013sea heat fluxes were computed as the slope between negative surface air\u2013sea heat fluxes and the positive sst anomaly averaged over the equatorial nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst region used to compute the thermal advection. the strength of this negative feedback was computed for both the growth phase of el nin\u0303o ( june\u2013september) and for its peak (november\u2013january).\nwind\u2013sst coupling is estimated as the slope between positive zonal wind stress anomalies and positive sst averaged over the central equatorial pacific and from june to september. mechanical coupling is estimated as the slope between positive zonal current and zonal wind stress anomalies averaged over the central equatorial pacific and from june to september. thermal coupling is the slope between the positive zonal thermal advection and zonal current anomalies averaged over the central equatorial pacific and from june to september. for all three responses involved in the feedback loop, the slope or coupling coefficient is computed using partial least-square regression between the positive anomalies involved in the growth of el nin\u0303o during boreal summer, that is, quantities averaged from june to september. the product of the three couplings is equivalent to the growth rate associated with the bjerknes feedback. the influence of each of these coupling mechanisms on the bjerknes feedback is isolated by keeping the other two couplings at the value for the 0 ka bp interval and then calculating the growth rate associated with each individual coupling (fig. 4b).\npacific ocean mean state at 21 ka the main text demonstrates model\u2013data parity between reconstructed and simulated ocean temperature variability in the surface and subsurface pacific ocean under lgm boundary conditions using cesm1.2 and ifa. additional assessments of the 21 ka simulation are previously published53,57; ref. 53 also validated simulated lgm patterns in the indo-pacific using a network of mean annual temperature proxies. however, assessments of the pattern and magnitude of mean annual temperature changes across the pacific ocean are more challenging because of both larger gaps in the proxy record43 owing to the size of the basin and large multiproxy uncertainty arising from conflicting proxy reconstructions42,43,70. furthermore, seasonal and depth-related biases in different proxies71\u2014including their stationarity72\u2014in tandem with calibration uncertainties73,74 complicate estimates of mean sst change. recent applications of palaeoclimate data assimilation techniques have made marked advances in circumventing the aforementioned biases by explicitly incorporating proxy system models to blend model output and palaeoproxy information43. moreover, data assimilation techniques provide globally complete reconstructions by leveraging local and remote information arising from available proxies. a recent assessment of four independent palaeoclimate assimilation reconstructions of the lgm (using both inverse and forward modelling of proxies) indicates that ssts in the eastern tropical pacific cooled more than the western pacific44 after accounting for proxy and spatial biases. this inference (see multimodel mean in fig. 1e in ref. 44) is in striking agreement with the simulated pattern and magnitude of surface-ocean cooling in our simulations. in cesm1.2, the eastern equatorial pacific cooling response is associated with a deeper thermocline during the lgm57 (fig. 4). whereas available estimates of changes in lgm thermocline depths have also been largely equivocal40,75,76, recent reappraisals of proxy data in the eastern39 and western41 tropical pacific strongly support a deeper thermocline. moreover, cesm1.2 shows thermocline deepening in the southern tropical western pacific41 and shoaling in the off-equatorial northern tropical pacific and in the southwest pacific (see fig. 8a in ref. 57), both features that are observed in proxy reconstructions40,41,75,76. accordingly, we suggest that these lines of evidence point to a thicker mixed layer across the pacific40 during the lgm, with a more substantial deepening of the thermocline in the eastern equatorial pacific39, pointing towards a stronger walker circulation26, as observed in the cesm1.2. simulations.",

required to activate the bjerknes feedback28. under glacial conditions, the bjerknes feedback is very weak (fig. 4b) and thus rarely activated. as a result, the frequency of extreme el nin\u0303o decreases to less than 20% compared with preindustrial levels. by contrast, under greenhouse warming, a stronger bjerknes feedback is more easily activated. as a result, more than 50% of simulated el nin\u0303o events reach extreme amplitude. the fact that enso variability does not vanish when the bjerknes feedback is very weak or negligible (for example, 12 ka bp, 15 ka bp and 18 ka bp intervals) indicates that all simulations have sufficient levels of stochastic variability controlled by other processes operating in the climate system.\nto determine how changes in the climate of the tropical pacific alter the frequency of extreme el nin\u0303o, we quantified the strength of coupled processes involved in the bjerknes feedback. we find that mechanical coupling between winds and ocean currents is the dominant physical process driving changes in growth rates associated with this positive feedback (fig. 4c, magenta curve compared with black curve; see the methods for details). this mechanical coupling of currents and winds is the weakest under glacial conditions, with reductions of up to 60%, and the strongest under greenhouse warming, increasing by more than 70%, relative to pi conditions (fig. 4c). low mechanical coupling under glacial conditions hinders the eastward expansion of the warm pool during the onset of el nin\u0303o and explains why fewer events reach peak amplitude. conversely, high mechanical coupling under greenhouse warming favours the eastward expansion of the warm pool and the activation of the bjerknes feedback. the responsiveness of winds to sst anomalies also plays an important part in the strength of the bjerknes feedback. this wind\u2013sst coupling is also weaker under glacial conditions and stronger under greenhouse warming (fig. 4c, blue curve). together, these two coupled processes explain most of the changes in the strength of the bjerknes feedback across climatic states (fig. 4c, black curve). the bjerknes feedback is also controlled by the magnitude of the climatological sst contrast across the equatorial pacific because this gradient governs the thermal advection by anomalous currents. this thermal coupling is stronger under glacial conditions and weaker under interglacial conditions (fig. 4c, green curve) and, therefore, cannot explain the simulated pattern of changes in extreme el nin\u0303o.\nthe strength of the coupling mechanisms, and, therefore, the frequency of extreme el nin\u0303o events across cold and warm climates, is ultimately tied to the strength of the pacific walker circulation. this influence is mediated by the changes in the depth of the oceanic mixed layer and the climatological extent of the warm pool. warmer climates are characterized by a weaker walker circulation, shallow oceanic mixed layer and an eastward expanded warm pool, whereas the opposite occurs for glacial climates (fig. 4d). in warmer climates, wind fluctuations transfer momentum to a thinner layer of upper ocean waters making zonal currents more responsive to wind variations during the onset of el nin\u0303o. moreover, winds are more responsive to sst anomalies because an eastward expanded warm pool favours convection over a larger area along the equatorial pacific. both factors promote rapid expansions of the warm pool during the onset of el nin\u0303o, allowing more events to reach extreme amplitude (fig. 5). the opposite scenario occurs under glacial conditions, in which the onset of extreme el nin\u0303o is hindered by less responsive ocean currents and winds because of a deeper mixed layer and a contracted warm pool\u2014both driven by a stronger walker circulation (fig. 5).\nthe anomalous temperature tendency because of thermal advection by zonal currents is positively correlated with positive sst anomalies in the equatorial nin\u0303o\u20133.4 region, consistent with a positive bjerknes feedback. this relationship indicates that during growing el nin\u0303o events, zonal currents weaken driven by the weakening trade winds, reducing the climatological cooling at the edge of the warm pool. this response translates into a warming of the central equatorial pacific driving a further weakening of the trade winds and equatorial currents, feeding back into the expanding warm pool during the growth of an el nin\u0303o event. partial least-square regression was used to compute the slope between the positive temperature tendency associated with the zonal thermal advection and the positive equatorial nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst anomaly. this slope represents the growth rate of sst anomalies in the central equatorial pacific driven by zonal thermal advection associated with the expansion of the warm pool. this growth rate is the main process contributing to the bjerknes feedback and reaches the peak amplitude during boreal summer when el nin\u0303o events grow (fig. 4a). the strength of the bjerknes feedback (fig. 4b) is computed using the slope of those same quantities (zonal thermal advection versus the positive nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst anomaly), but averaged from june to september before computing the slope. damping rates associated with air\u2013sea heat fluxes were computed as the slope between negative surface air\u2013sea heat fluxes and the positive sst anomaly averaged over the equatorial nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst region used to compute the thermal advection. the strength of this negative feedback was computed for both the growth phase of el nin\u0303o ( june\u2013september) and for its peak (november\u2013january).\nwind\u2013sst coupling is estimated as the slope between positive zonal wind stress anomalies and positive sst averaged over the central equatorial pacific and from june to september. mechanical coupling is estimated as the slope between positive zonal current and zonal wind stress anomalies averaged over the central equatorial pacific and from june to september. thermal coupling is the slope between the positive zonal thermal advection and zonal current anomalies averaged over the central equatorial pacific and from june to september. for all three responses involved in the feedback loop, the slope or coupling coefficient is computed using partial least-square regression between the positive anomalies involved in the growth of el nin\u0303o during boreal summer, that is, quantities averaged from june to september. the product of the three couplings is equivalent to the growth rate associated with the bjerknes feedback. the influence of each of these coupling mechanisms on the bjerknes feedback is isolated by keeping the other two couplings at the value for the 0 ka bp interval and then calculating the growth rate associated with each individual coupling (fig. 4b).\npacific ocean mean state at 21 ka the main text demonstrates model\u2013data parity between reconstructed and simulated ocean temperature variability in the surface and subsurface pacific ocean under lgm boundary conditions using cesm1.2 and ifa. additional assessments of the 21 ka simulation are previously published53,57; ref. 53 also validated simulated lgm patterns in the indo-pacific using a network of mean annual temperature proxies. however, assessments of the pattern and magnitude of mean annual temperature changes across the pacific ocean are more challenging because of both larger gaps in the proxy record43 owing to the size of the basin and large multiproxy uncertainty arising from conflicting proxy reconstructions42,43,70. furthermore, seasonal and depth-related biases in different proxies71\u2014including their stationarity72\u2014in tandem with calibration uncertainties73,74 complicate estimates of mean sst change. recent applications of palaeoclimate data assimilation techniques have made marked advances in circumventing the aforementioned biases by explicitly incorporating proxy system models to blend model output and palaeoproxy information43. moreover, data assimilation techniques provide globally complete reconstructions by leveraging local and remote information arising from available proxies. a recent assessment of four independent palaeoclimate assimilation reconstructions of the lgm (using both inverse and forward modelling of proxies) indicates that ssts in the eastern tropical pacific cooled more than the western pacific44 after accounting for proxy and spatial biases. this inference (see multimodel mean in fig. 1e in ref. 44) is in striking agreement with the simulated pattern and magnitude of surface-ocean cooling in our simulations. in cesm1.2, the eastern equatorial pacific cooling response is associated with a deeper thermocline during the lgm57 (fig. 4). whereas available estimates of changes in lgm thermocline depths have also been largely equivocal40,75,76, recent reappraisals of proxy data in the eastern39 and western41 tropical pacific strongly support a deeper thermocline. moreover, cesm1.2 shows thermocline deepening in the southern tropical western pacific41 and shoaling in the off-equatorial northern tropical pacific and in the southwest pacific (see fig. 8a in ref. 57), both features that are observed in proxy reconstructions40,41,75,76. accordingly, we suggest that these lines of evidence point to a thicker mixed layer across the pacific40 during the lgm, with a more substantial deepening of the thermocline in the eastern equatorial pacific39, pointing towards a stronger walker circulation26, as observed in the cesm1.2. simulations.",

ocean under lgm boundary conditions using cesm1.2 and ifa. additional assessments of the 21 ka simulation are previously published53,57; ref. 53 also validated simulated lgm patterns in the indo-pacific using a network of mean annual temperature proxies. however, assessments of the pattern and magnitude of mean annual temperature changes across the pacific ocean are more challenging because of both larger gaps in the proxy record43 owing to the size of the basin and large multiproxy uncertainty arising from conflicting proxy reconstructions42,43,70. furthermore, seasonal and depth-related biases in different proxies71\u2014including their stationarity72\u2014in tandem with calibration uncertainties73,74 complicate estimates of mean sst change. recent applications of palaeoclimate data assimilation techniques have made marked advances in circumventing the aforementioned biases by explicitly incorporating proxy system models to blend model output and palaeoproxy information43. moreover, data assimilation techniques provide globally complete reconstructions by leveraging local and remote information arising from available proxies. a recent assessment of four independent palaeoclimate assimilation reconstructions of the lgm (using both inverse and forward modelling of proxies) indicates that ssts in the eastern tropical pacific cooled more than the western pacific44 after accounting for proxy and spatial biases. this inference (see multimodel mean in fig. 1e in ref. 44) is in striking agreement with the simulated pattern and magnitude of surface-ocean cooling in our simulations. in cesm1.2, the eastern equatorial pacific cooling response is associated with a deeper thermocline during the lgm57 (fig. 4). whereas available estimates of changes in lgm thermocline depths have also been largely equivocal40,75,76, recent reappraisals of proxy data in the eastern39 and western41 tropical pacific strongly support a deeper thermocline. moreover, cesm1.2 shows thermocline deepening in the southern tropical western pacific41 and shoaling in the off-equatorial northern tropical pacific and in the southwest pacific (see fig. 8a in ref. 57), both features that are observed in proxy reconstructions40,41,75,76. accordingly, we suggest that these lines of evidence point to a thicker mixed layer across the pacific40 during the lgm, with a more substantial deepening of the thermocline in the eastern equatorial pacific39, pointing towards a stronger walker circulation26, as observed in the cesm1.2. simulations.",

        "context": "our simulations show that the strength of the bjerknes feedback in each climate state is correlated with the fraction of el nin\u0303o events that reach extreme amplitude (\u22652 k; ref. 7). warmer climates show the strongest growth rate of simulated sst anomalies in the central pacific, particularly during boreal summer when el nin\u0303o events develop (fig. 4a). by contrast, these growth rates are negligible under glacial conditions. their summertime magnitude\u2014the strength of the bjerknes feedback\u2014is highly correlated (r = 0.98, p-value < 10\u22126) with the mean amplitude of el nin\u0303o events in each climatic state (fig. 4b). this relationship supports a causal link between the changes in the strength of the bjerknes feedback and the frequency of el nin\u0303o events that reach extreme amplitude. the higher growth rates during boreal summer are consistent with the notion that stochastic wind variability during this season has the largest impact on the amplitude of extreme el nin\u0303o28.\nextreme el nin\u0303o events are not very frequent under preindustrial conditions because sustained levels of wind fluctuations are required to activate the bjerknes feedback28. under glacial conditions, the bjerknes feedback is very weak (fig. 4b) and thus rarely activated. as a result, the frequency of extreme el nin\u0303o decreases to less than 20% compared with preindustrial levels. by contrast, under greenhouse warming, a stronger bjerknes feedback is more easily activated. as a result, more than 50% of simulated el nin\u0303o events reach extreme amplitude. the fact that enso variability does not vanish when the bjerknes feedback is very weak or negligible (for example, 12 ka bp, 15 ka bp and 18 ka bp intervals) indicates that all simulations have sufficient levels of stochastic variability controlled by other processes operating in the climate system.\nto determine how changes in the climate of the tropical pacific alter the frequency of extreme el nin\u0303o, we quantified the strength of coupled processes involved in the bjerknes feedback. we find that mechanical coupling between winds and ocean currents is the dominant physical process driving changes in growth rates associated with this positive feedback (fig. 4c, magenta curve compared with black curve; see the methods for details). this mechanical coupling of currents and winds is the weakest under glacial conditions, with reductions of up to 60%, and the strongest under greenhouse warming, increasing by more than 70%, relative to pi conditions (fig. 4c). low mechanical coupling under glacial conditions hinders the eastward expansion of the warm pool during the onset of el nin\u0303o and explains why fewer events reach peak amplitude. conversely, high mechanical coupling under greenhouse warming favours the eastward expansion of the warm pool and the activation of the bjerknes feedback. the responsiveness of winds to sst anomalies also plays an important part in the strength of the bjerknes feedback. this wind\u2013sst coupling is also weaker under glacial conditions and stronger under greenhouse warming (fig. 4c, blue curve). together, these two coupled processes explain most of the changes in the strength of the bjerknes feedback across climatic states (fig. 4c, black curve). the bjerknes feedback is also controlled by the magnitude of the climatological sst contrast across the equatorial pacific because this gradient governs the thermal advection by anomalous currents. this thermal coupling is stronger under glacial conditions and weaker under interglacial conditions (fig. 4c, green curve) and, therefore, cannot explain the simulated pattern of changes in extreme el nin\u0303o.\nthe strength of the coupling mechanisms, and, therefore, the frequency of extreme el nin\u0303o events across cold and warm climates, is ultimately tied to the strength of the pacific walker circulation. this influence is mediated by the changes in the depth of the oceanic mixed layer and the climatological extent of the warm pool. warmer climates are characterized by a weaker walker circulation, shallow oceanic mixed layer and an eastward expanded warm pool, whereas the opposite occurs for glacial climates (fig. 4d). in warmer climates, wind fluctuations transfer momentum to a thinner layer of upper ocean waters making zonal currents more responsive to wind variations during the onset of el nin\u0303o. moreover, winds are more responsive to sst anomalies because an eastward expanded warm pool favours convection over a larger area along the equatorial pacific. both factors promote rapid expansions of the warm pool during the onset of el nin\u0303o, allowing more events to reach extreme amplitude (fig. 5). the opposite scenario occurs under glacial conditions, in which the onset of extreme el nin\u0303o is hindered by less responsive ocean currents and winds because of a deeper mixed layer and a contracted warm pool\u2014both driven by a stronger walker circulation (fig. 5).\nthe anomalous temperature tendency because of thermal advection by zonal currents is positively correlated with positive sst anomalies in the equatorial nin\u0303o\u20133.4 region, consistent with a positive bjerknes feedback. this relationship indicates that during growing el nin\u0303o events, zonal currents weaken driven by the weakening trade winds, reducing the climatological cooling at the edge of the warm pool. this response translates into a warming of the central equatorial pacific driving a further weakening of the trade winds and equatorial currents, feeding back into the expanding warm pool during the growth of an el nin\u0303o event. partial least-square regression was used to compute the slope between the positive temperature tendency associated with the zonal thermal advection and the positive equatorial nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst anomaly. this slope represents the growth rate of sst anomalies in the central equatorial pacific driven by zonal thermal advection associated with the expansion of the warm pool. this growth rate is the main process contributing to the bjerknes feedback and reaches the peak amplitude during boreal summer when el nin\u0303o events grow (fig. 4a). the strength of the bjerknes feedback (fig. 4b) is computed using the slope of those same quantities (zonal thermal advection versus the positive nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst anomaly), but averaged from june to september before computing the slope. damping rates associated with air\u2013sea heat fluxes were computed as the slope between negative surface air\u2013sea heat fluxes and the positive sst anomaly averaged over the equatorial nin\u0303o\u20133.4 sst region used to compute the thermal advection. the strength of this negative feedback was computed for both the growth phase of el nin\u0303o ( june\u2013september) and for its peak (november\u2013january).\nwind\u2013sst coupling is estimated as the slope between positive zonal wind stress anomalies and positive sst averaged over the central equatorial pacific and from june to september. mechanical coupling is estimated as the slope between positive zonal current and zonal wind stress anomalies averaged over the central equatorial pacific and from june to september. thermal coupling is the slope between the positive zonal thermal advection and zonal current anomalies averaged over the central equatorial pacific and from june to september. for all three responses involved in the feedback loop, the slope or coupling coefficient is computed using partial least-square regression between the positive anomalies involved in the growth of el nin\u0303o during boreal summer, that is, quantities averaged from june to september. the product of the three couplings is equivalent to the growth rate associated with the bjerknes feedback. the influence of each of these coupling mechanisms on the bjerknes feedback is isolated by keeping the other two couplings at the value for the 0 ka bp interval and then calculating the growth rate associated with each individual coupling (fig. 4b).\npacific ocean mean state at 21 ka the main text demonstrates model\u2013data parity between reconstructed and simulated ocean temperature variability in the surface and subsurface pacific

        "context": "combining the non-advective-diffusive and advective-diffusive fluxes, our globally integrated toc flux at the base of the euphotic zone is 15.00 \u00b1 1.12 pg c year\u22121 (fig. 4a). this number is sensitive to the export horizon owing to strong remineralization in the upper ocean. for example, the export flux decreases by roughly 30% from 73 m to the 100-m-depth horizon typically used by esms as a reference export depth. an alternative perspective on this sensitivity is provided by distribution functions for the sequestration time, \u03c4, of organic carbon production and for the stock of regenerated dic (fig. 5). the toc production with \u03c4 > 3 months is 11.09 \u00b1 1.02 pg c year\u22121. for \u03c4 > 1 year, the total export flux decreases to 8.25 \u00b1 0.30 pg c year\u22121 and for \u03c4 > 3 years, it is only 6.30 \u00b1 0.09 pg c year\u22121. the distribution functions show that the total flux is dominated by small residence-time export, but that the small residence-time fluxes contribute negligibly to the standing stock of regenerated dic, pointing to the rapid recycling of much of the organic matter production on short timescales. for \u03c4 < 1 year (yellow regions in fig. 5), the accuracy of export fluxes is highly uncertain as a result of three main factors. first, the circulation model lacks representation of the seasonal cycle. second, the short residence-time fluxes are sensitive to the mathematical formulation of the biological production and respiration models. last, the inverse model, which is constrained by carbon, oxygen and nutrient stocks, is insensitive to the part of the export-flux distribution that does not affect these stocks.\nour estimated toc flux rate at 100 m (10.64 \u00b1 0.80 pg c year\u22121) falls into the range of the previous model and satellite-based predictions (5\u201312 pg c year\u22121, summarized in ref. 14 in their table 1) and is in close agreement with the \u2018baseline\u2019 estimate of 10.2 pg c year\u22121 using an ensemble numerical model constrained with o2 and doc observations24. there are no direct global-scale annual toc flux measurements because extensive samplings would be needed to resolve the seasonal cycle of all export pathways. reliable ancp (equivalent to toc flux at steady state) estimates are only available at time-series stations and some basins based on regional argo float data35. on basin scales, our results align with the geochemical ancp in the pacific ocean and north atlantic ocean35 (fig. 4b,c). the magnitude of our estimated toc export flux varies meridionally by approximately a factor of three, indicating a smaller gradient compared with previous esm-based or satellite-based estimates, which typically suggest that toc export varies by up to a",

        "context": "that may have shaped the most fundamental aspects of earth\u2019s physical environment and played an overarching role in determining broad biological outcomes in the tropics1,3. first, we revealed a substantial degree of diversity dependence within ostracod assemblages, with a strong negative correlation between diversity and speciation rate (correlation parameter g = \u22122.735, strength of correlation parameter \u03c9 = 0.863; fig. 2a and supplementary table 2). accordingly, we observe a long-term decrease in speciation rate and an approximately logistic growth of diversity for the neogene\u2013quaternary development of the iaa hotspot (fig. 1a,d), which is consistent with the bounded diversity hypothesis24\u201326. indeed, lineages and communities may commonly experience a slowdown in their diversification rates coupled with a damped increase in diversity. higher numbers of species may indicate increased biotic (competitive) interactions and expanded niche occupancy in a region, which conversely reduces ecological opportunities for speciation24,26. finite resources, ultimately determined by extrinsic factors (for example, climate and regional area), may result in an upper limit to the niche space shared by all species, and thus hypothetically limit the maximum diversity that can be achieved as \u2018carrying capacity\u201924. bounded diversification seems to be a recurrent and pervasive pattern in macroevolutionary studies across different times, places and taxa, although empirical evidence for diversity truly exhausting its potential to increase with niche saturation remains scarce25. in our case of the iaa hotspot, it seems that long-term diversification since about 25 ma has led to a steady, asymptotic phase of equilibrium diversity following the plio-pleistocene transition about 2.6 ma. this may represent the maturation of the iaa hotspot after a long neogene history of expansion, but the possibility of future diversity growth remains if the carrying capacity increases in response to changing environmental conditions, or if a key innovation evolves to conquer new niche space25,26, which would make the current phase only a diversity plateau in the hotspot\u2019s life cycle. in addition to diversity dependence that imposed a strong biotic control on the iaa, we showed that habitat size (shelf area) as the most important abiotic determinant has a positive, albeit weak, effect on speciation, indicating an evolutionary species\u2013area relationship (g = 2.272 \u00d7 10\u22127, \u03c9 = 0.647;

\u03c9 = 0.272; fig. 2a and supplementary table 2). our results seem to contradict previous theories suggesting that complex island archipelagos of the iaa with an extensive array of shallow seas accelerate allopatric speciation through vicariance, although isolated small populations may also face higher extinction risks1,3. the effects of habitat complexity on regional diversification are worthy of further investigation. indeed, in the marine realm, dispersal (both positive and negative) as the dominant process may overwhelm the effects of isolation at a regional scale, for which the physical barriers\nare often permeable and relatively sparse30\u201332. connectivity among marine basins may be substantially restricted because of a dynamic mosaic of ever-changing geographic and oceanographic conditions within the iaa, but not strictly or permanently blocked, and thus undermines the effectiveness of conventional allopatry. instead, our findings may imply the importance of sympatric speciation, given the positive effect of habitat size but no effect of habitat complexity31,33. in large, continuous shelf habitats across wide environmental gradients, such as the iaa, diversification may occur along ecological partitions (that is, intense competition invokes finer subdivision and niche specialization) in addition to geographic partitions25,31\u201333. evidence of sympatric speciation is prevalent among marine clades of all different dispersal abilities and life histories, ranging from fishes, to corals, to gastropods and to ostracods31,33,34, which potentially highlights the importance of ecological factors in marine diversification. collectively, our mbd analysis partly supports the hopping hotspots model that proposes tectonic activity as the principal forcer of biodiversity hotspot by creating larger and more complex shallow-marine habitats1,9. we instead suggest that suitable habitat in terms of size but not complexity is important for the generation of enormous iaa diversity throughout the cenozoic. however, note that the habitat estimations available now are based on global palaeogeographic reconstructions, so some uncertainty remains about the accuracy of such an inference. other than the habitat factors, global temperature and sea level do not significantly correlate with diversity dynamics in the entire time frame analysis (g parameters overlapping with zero; fig. 2a and supplementary table 2). this seemingly indicates that not all tectonic, eustatic, climatic, oceanographic and geomorphological processes1 are as critical as previously thought in fostering a biodiversity hotspot, or their short-term effects may be masked across a long-time frame (see the next section). after establishing the general long-term drivers of the iaa\u2019s diversification dynamics, we then scrutinized how their effects may vary over time across different climate regimes35. a time-stratified mbd analysis revealed further details for the warm phase (23.04\u201313.9 ma), cooling phase (13.9\u20135.33 ma) and cold phase (5.33\u20130 ma) of the neogene\u2013quaternary interval (fig. 2b\u2013d and supplementary tables 3\u20135). the results for the cold phase are highly concordant with those for the entire time frame, with diversity (g = -3.341, \u03c9 = 0.912) and habitat size (g = 2.445 \u00d7 10\u22127, \u03c9 = 0.702) negatively and positively affecting speciation, respectively (fig. 2d and supplementary table 5). higher sea level also expedited speciation during this interval (g = 0.022, \u03c9 = 0.819), probably through the species\u2013area relationship. large and frequent fluctuations in sea level associated with the glacial cycles may strongly affect the expansion and contraction of epicontinental seas and consequently the size of shallow-marine habitats36,37. there is no correlation between diversification dynamics and any biotic or abiotic factors for the cooling phase (fig. 2c and supplementary table 4), which may indicate it as a transitional stage between two opposite climate regimes. indeed, during the warm phase, biotic and abiotic controls on the diversification of iaa faunas occurred in very different ways from those of the cold phase (fig. 2b and supplementary table 3). the strong positive effect of diversity on extinction conforms to our understanding of diversity dependency (g = 336.168, \u03c9 = 1), but its positive effect on speciation (g = 25.093, \u03c9 = 0.999) may be explained\nalso drove the biogeographic evolution of the iaa hotspot (extended data fig. 5). diversification initiated in the iaa with concurrent speciation and extinction peaks at 25 ma, when australia first collided with southeast asia21,29. the second and the largest peak in both speciation and extinction occurred at 20 ma. it correlated in time with two major tectonic events outside and within the iaa, namely the closure of the tethys seaway separating the indo-pacific from the mediterranean sea and atlantic ocean9,48, and the closure of the indonesian deep-water passage between southeast asia and australia21. the first event enabled the delineation of the indo-pacific biogeographic province through the breakup of the formerly global tropical sea belt (that is, the tethys sea), which could naturally spur both speciation and extinction through large-scale vicariance. also, the loss of western connectivity placed the iaa in the geographic centre of vast indo-pacific oceans, where the overlapping of species distributional ranges could translate to a centre of diversity (that is, mid domain effect)49. the second event established a shallow-marine connection between southeast asia and australia for the first time and thus assembled a large expanse of shelf seas as suitable habitat for diversification. it could have also facilitated the convergence of peripheral faunas in the central iaa, leading to an increase in regional diversity and changes in biogeographic patterns. then, the 16-ma peak coincided with the mid-miocene climatic optimum40, which is in line with our mbd results indicating that both speciation and extinction rates accelerated with high temperature in a warm climate state (fig. 2b). similar diversification peaks at about 18 and 15 ma were also found in caribbean bryozoans8, which may correspond to our 20-ma and 16-ma events. the 12-ma peak was apparent only in the speciation rate when the east asian monsoon intensified50. a stronger regional environmental gradient, such as salinity through the enhanced monsoon and resulting precipitation, could provide a possible explanation. finally, the 5-ma speciation and extinction peaks may be related to the restriction of the indonesian throughflow at the miocene\u2013pliocene boundary38,51, which allowed reversed faunal dispersal from the indian ocean to the pacific ocean3. in summary, abrupt transitions in earth\u2019s physical environments probably introduced short-term instability into the biotic system. for each of the biotic events, extinctions were overcompensated with much stronger speciation to support overall diversification, indicating the role of the iaa as a reservoir for species accumulation and a source of species origination.",

\u03c9 = 0.272; fig. 2a and supplementary table 2). our results seem to contradict previous theories suggesting that complex island archipelagos of the iaa with an extensive array of shallow seas accelerate allopatric speciation through vicariance, although isolated small populations may also face higher extinction risks1,3. the effects of habitat complexity on regional diversification are worthy of further investigation. indeed, in the marine realm, dispersal (both positive and negative) as the dominant process may overwhelm the effects of isolation at a regional scale, for which the physical barriers\nare often permeable and relatively sparse30\u201332. connectivity among marine basins may be substantially restricted because of a dynamic mosaic of ever-changing geographic and oceanographic conditions within the iaa, but not strictly or permanently blocked, and thus undermines the effectiveness of conventional allopatry. instead, our findings may imply the importance of sympatric speciation, given the positive effect of habitat size but no effect of habitat complexity31,33. in large, continuous shelf habitats across wide environmental gradients, such as the iaa, diversification may occur along ecological partitions (that is, intense competition invokes finer subdivision and niche specialization) in addition to geographic partitions25,31\u201333. evidence of sympatric speciation is prevalent among marine clades of all different dispersal abilities and life histories, ranging from fishes, to corals, to gastropods and to ostracods31,33,34, which potentially highlights the importance of ecological factors in marine diversification. collectively, our mbd analysis partly supports the hopping hotspots model that proposes tectonic activity as the principal forcer of biodiversity hotspot by creating larger and more complex shallow-marine habitats1,9. we instead suggest that suitable habitat in terms of size but not complexity is important for the generation of enormous iaa diversity throughout the cenozoic. however, note that the habitat estimations available now are based on global palaeogeographic reconstructions, so some uncertainty remains about the accuracy of such an inference. other than the habitat factors, global temperature and sea level do not significantly correlate with diversity dynamics in the entire time frame analysis (g parameters overlapping with zero; fig. 2a and supplementary table 2). this seemingly indicates that not all tectonic, eustatic, climatic, oceanographic and geomorphological processes1 are as critical as previously thought in fostering a biodiversity hotspot, or their short-term effects may be masked across a long-time frame (see the next section). after establishing the general long-term drivers of the iaa\u2019s diversification dynamics, we then scrutinized how their effects may vary over time across different climate regimes35. a time-stratified mbd analysis revealed further details for the warm phase (23.04\u201313.9 ma), cooling phase (13.9\u20135.33 ma) and cold phase (5.33\u20130 ma) of the neogene\u2013quaternary interval (fig. 2b\u2013d and supplementary tables 3\u20135). the results for the cold phase are highly concordant with those for the entire time frame, with diversity (g = -3.341, \u03c9 = 0.912) and habitat size (g = 2.445 \u00d7 10\u22127, \u03c9 = 0.702) negatively and positively affecting speciation, respectively (fig. 2d and supplementary table 5). higher sea level also expedited speciation during this interval (g = 0.022, \u03c9 = 0.819), probably through the species\u2013area relationship. large and frequent fluctuations in sea level associated with the glacial cycles may strongly affect the expansion and contraction of epicontinental seas and consequently the size of shallow-marine habitats36,37. there is no correlation between diversification dynamics and any biotic or abiotic factors for the cooling phase (fig. 2c and supplementary table 4), which may indicate it as a transitional stage between two opposite climate regimes. indeed, during the warm phase, biotic and abiotic controls on the diversification of iaa faunas occurred in very different ways from those of the cold phase (fig. 2b and supplementary table 3). the strong positive effect of diversity on extinction conforms to our understanding of diversity dependency (g = 336.168, \u03c9 = 1), but its positive effect on speciation (g = 25.093, \u03c9 = 0.999) may be explained\nalso drove the biogeographic evolution of the iaa hotspot (extended data fig. 5). diversification initiated in the iaa with concurrent speciation and extinction peaks at 25 ma, when australia first collided with southeast asia21,29. the second and the largest peak in both speciation and extinction occurred at 20 ma. it correlated in time with two major tectonic events outside and within the iaa, namely the closure of the tethys seaway separating the indo-pacific from the mediterranean sea and atlantic ocean9,48, and the closure of the indonesian deep-water passage between southeast asia and australia21. the first event enabled the delineation of the indo-pacific biogeographic province through the breakup of the formerly global tropical sea belt (that is, the tethys sea), which could naturally spur both speciation and extinction through large-scale vicariance. also, the loss of western connectivity placed the iaa in the geographic centre of vast indo-pacific oceans, where the overlapping of species distributional ranges could translate to a centre of diversity (that is, mid domain effect)49. the second event established a shallow-marine connection between southeast asia and australia for the first time and thus assembled a large expanse of shelf seas as suitable habitat for diversification. it could have also facilitated the convergence of peripheral faunas in the central iaa, leading to an increase in regional diversity and changes in biogeographic patterns. then, the 16-ma peak coincided with the mid-miocene climatic optimum40, which is in line with our mbd results indicating that both speciation and extinction rates accelerated with high temperature in a warm climate state (fig. 2b). similar diversification peaks at about 18 and 15 ma were also found in caribbean bryozoans8, which may correspond to our 20-ma and 16-ma events. the 12-ma peak was apparent only in the speciation rate when the east asian monsoon intensified50. a stronger regional environmental gradient, such as salinity through the enhanced monsoon and resulting precipitation, could provide a possible explanation. finally, the 5-ma speciation and extinction peaks may be related to the restriction of the indonesian throughflow at the miocene\u2013pliocene boundary38,51, which allowed reversed faunal dispersal from the indian ocean to the pacific ocean3. in summary, abrupt transitions in earth\u2019s physical environments probably introduced short-term instability into the biotic system. for each of the biotic events, extinctions were overcompensated with much stronger speciation to support overall diversification, indicating the role of the iaa as a reservoir for species accumulation and a source of species origination.",

see methods) reaches 1.54 \u00b0c, similar to beneath the pine island ice shelf23. a highly salt-stratified basal boundary layer is seen within 2 m of the ice\u2013ocean boundary, where the sharp gradient in absolute salinity (sa) creates a strong barrier to vertical mixing (extended data fig. 1a). although density in the polar regions is set by salinity and thus the grounding-zone water column is stably stratified (fig. 2c), the vertical gradient of conservative temperature (\u03b8) is unstable with respect to density (that is, cold water lies above warm water) and the water column might be susceptible to diffusive convection. although this double-diffusive process could provide a limited source of energy for vertical mixing24\u201326, with an average density ratio of only 0.2 and a turner angle of \u221257\u00b0, the temperature gradient is too weak to sustain a thermohaline staircase (extended data fig. 1b;

however, we cannot rule out a more northerly source from thwaites trough22,28 (fig. 1). in the well-mixed lower layer, the ctd data shift onto a slightly warmer meltwater mixing line (source water \u03b8 = 0.18 \u00b0c;

see methods). the meltwater distribution indicates that ocean water at all depths has interacted with an ice-shelf base, consistent with the narrow water column and proximity to the grounding line. at the grounding line itself, the glacial meltwater concentration observed by icefin reaches a maximum value of approximately 31 ml l\u22121 (fig. 2c). this is close to the saturation value of approximately 35 ml l\u22121, at which point \u03b8 is at the in situ freezing point and no further basal melting can occur.\nfor the time series data in a coloured as a function of time. the blue and red dot-dashed lines are meltwater mixing lines that fit the observed data for january 2020 (blue) and august 2020 (red). the purple dot-dashed line is a mixing line between the grounding-zone \u03b8 and sa values in august 2020 and fresh subglacial runoff. the solid black line indicates the ambient mcdw\u2013ww thermocline from ship-based ctd data (fig. 2c), whereas the red-shaded box indicates the range of \u03b8 and sa values of the mcdw endmember. the grey dots show the ctd data from the borehole. e, velocity vectors from the sub-ice current meter coloured as a function of time. radial contours indicate flow speed in cm s\u22121.\nbasal melting, controlled by the rate at which turbulent ocean mixing transports heat and salt vertically to the ice-shelf base through the ice shelf\u2013ocean boundary layer40, is highly suppressed beneath teis by the strong stratification and quiescent ocean environment. different boundary-layer turbulence regimes have been identified depending on the relative strength of the vertical current shear and buoyancy forcing: well-mixed shear controlled, stratified buoyancy controlled and diffusive-convective8,41. as the boundary layer beneath teis is characterized by weak current speeds (fig. 4) and strong stratification (fig. 2a), the well-mixed shear-controlled regime is precluded42. the temperature gradient is too weak to sustain strong diffusive-convective turbulence26 (extended data fig. 1b) and thus the transport of heat\nthrough the boundary layer is predominantly controlled by stratified turbulence dynamics7,8. in this regime, weak flow speeds cannot generate sufficient shear-driven turbulence to overcome the highly stable ice-base stratification, strongly suppressing the vertical heat (and salt) transport to the ice base and, ultimately, the basal melt rate, despite strong thermal forcing7 (fig. 2a). in the buoyancy-controlled regime beneath teis, basal melting is largely rate-limited by the density stratification and current speed, which control heat transport to the ice base, rather than by the amount of heat available. teis already exhibits excess levels of thermal driving (that is, there is more ocean heat available than that required to maintain basal melting) and the temperature increase required to drive substantially higher basal melt rates is probably unfeasible. instead, order-of-magnitude increases in basal melting will only be driven by a large-scale acceleration in ocean circulation or a marked weakening of the ice-base stratification.\nglacial meltwater and subglacial discharge fractions meltwater fractions are calculated using the composite tracer method27 and water-mass endmembers derived from the ship-based ctd profiles. in the absence of glacial meltwater or subglacial discharge, it is assumed that the ambient water column beneath teis would be composed exclusively of mcdw and ww that mix along a straight line between their corresponding endmembers61 (fig. 2c and extended data fig. 7). for each conservative temperature and absolute salinity observation, a composite tracer can be constructed\nthe conservative temperature and absolute salinity of the mcdw and ww endmembers were extracted from the ship-based ctd casts collected in front of teis (fig. 2c). the properties of the ww endmember",

        "context": "to explore changes in the influence of mr on poc flux attenuation (fig. 2), we normalized mr to incubation time and cumulative poc flux (methods). the derived c-specific remineralization rate (cremin) ranged from 0.02 d\u22121 to 0.43 d\u22121 across sites and depths (fig. 3a). the upper bound (0.43 d\u22121) is several-fold higher than that in previous studies21,23, which subsampled the settling particle assemblage. our range, when reformulated as cremin, demonstrates that the particle flux supplied enough c (extended data fig. 1 caption) to sustain particle-attached microbial needs in the upper mesopelagic, an unresolved issue highlighted previously4,29 (but see ref. 30). this 20-fold range in cremin may be controlled by both site-specific and depth-dependent factors. comparison of cremin across sites reveals no clear relationship with the magnitude of cumulative poc flux (based on the shallowest c-respire). such a relationship is probably confounded by differing biogeochemical characteristics across the sites including: depth of the primary production zone (ppz); proportion of large diatoms; lability of particles (spring bloom (sg) versus highly transformed (spsg)); biogenic (saz) versus lithogenic (med); and resulting seasonality of particle properties. these multi-faceted characteristics preclude robust statistical analysis, for example, large diatoms contributed to the setting poc flux at sg (extended data table 3) where high fluxes were little attenuated by microbes (fig. 2). in contrast, changes in cremin with depth reveal more distinct trends.\nvertical trends in cremin differ between regions (fig. 3a). at sg, saz, papa and med, cremin increased with depth, as expected (extended data fig. 4) considering the approximately constant mr-mediated versus decreasing cumulative poc fluxes (fig. 2). however, decreasing cremin with depth was observed at sites with larger vertical temperature gradients (ben (r2 = 0.29) and spsg (r2 = 0.43)). when plotted against temperature31 (fig. 3b), depth-dependent cremin patterns generally become more conspicuous, suggesting a demarcation in these distinctive trends at sites with vertical gradients of more than 2 \u00b0c (r2 = 0.80 and r2 = 0.39 at ben and spsg, respectively).\nmodes of control on cremin mesopelagic temperatures may influence the marked transition in the cremin versus depth relationship between sites (fig. 3). temperature is a key driver of microbial community composition32, metabolic activity33 and organic matter decomposition34,35. the latter two properties are reflected by thermal performance curves (that is, growth or respiration versus temperature36\u201338) of isolates of marine microbes. temperature has been proposed as the driver of particle flux attenuation in the palaeo-oceanographic39 and contemporary7 oceans. temperature may control cremin at subtropical sites (ben and spsg; fig. 3b) with pronounced mesopelagic gradients (extended data fig. 5). a similar cremin pattern was reported at bermuda (subtropical atlantic), using a c-respire prototype40. this raises the question of whether temperature also exerts control on cremin at mid- and high-latitude sites where mr is relatively invariant with depth (excluding outliers at ben and med; fig. 2a) and cremin increases (fig. 3).\nmid- and high-latitude sites have upper mesopelagic gradients of less than 2 \u00b0c (fig. 3b). although no thermal performance curves exist for mesopelagic microbes (that is, under in situ conditions), this physiology versus temperature relationship36\u201338 helps explore the implications of different temperature gradients on cremin. each temperature\u2013cremin\nrelationship (fig. 3b) can be recast using the characteristic shape of a thermal performance curve (fig. 4a). although it is not known where on a curve these temperature\u2013cremin data would lie, a marked change in cremin with temperature (straddling slope and plateau) is more likely for a 5 \u00b0c gradient than a less than 2 \u00b0c gradient (fig. 4a). thus, at midand high-latitude sites, the influence of temperature on cremin may be diminished, enabling additional factors to set depth-dependent patterns in cremin. next, we examine the regional characteristics at these mid- and high-latitude sites that may define the functioning of their biological carbon pumps.\nto explore the reasons for the two distinct trends in cremin (fig. 3), there is insufficient knowledge of the drivers of mr based on the current parameterization of marine models of mr17. we draw on advances from soil microbiology ( joint role of bacterial strain and biochemical substrate on physiology), marine pelagic physiology (thermal performance curves) and mesopelagic microbial ecology (altered community structure with depth) to explore potential explanations.\nat higher-latitude sites with small temperature gradients, depthdependent increases in cremin (fig. 3) may be disproportionately influenced by vertical gradients in particle characteristics (for example, substrate availability), ecological shifts (community) and/or physiological changes (exo-enzymes to match substrate changes) of particle-attached microbes41. for example, the joint and complex influence of temperature and substrate on marine bacterial physiological performance is long established42,43. there is indirect evidence of depth-dependent changes in rq based on a comparison of quotients from unmodified directly sinking phytoplankton cells (rq = 0.89 (ref. 44)), marine snow (rq = 0.70 (ref. 45)) to heavily modified particles (rq = 0.50 (ref. 46)) that suggest that the number of particle transformations as they sink results in altered particle substrate quality with depth (fig. 4b).\nmicrobial soil studies show that enzymatic decomposition of biochemically recalcitrant organic matter requires high activation energy, and is more sensitive to changes in temperature than decomposition of more labile organic matter47,48. soil microbiology studies suggest that the thermal sensitivity of the bacterial growth efficiency (bge; analogous to carbon-use efficiency) is both substrate dependent49 (fig. 4b) and strain dependent49,50 (fig. 4c). for soil microbes, across multiple substrate and strain permutations49,50, there are combinations in which the bge versus temperature relationship is positive, that is, bge decreases (for example, respiration increases more than growth) at lower temperatures. if this relationship holds for oceanic regions, this would increase mr with depth (fig. 4c). these scenarios are consistent with increasing cremin with depth at some higher-latitude sites (fig. 3b) and offer the most compelling explanation currently available. in addition to the likelihood of depth dependency of substrate quality41, there is evidence of changes in microbial community structure and function with depth50,51 that together could provide such substrate and strain combinations49,50 leading to a constancy in mr (fig. 2a) in contrast to the power-law decrease in cumulative poc flux, and hence higher cremin at depth (fig. 4c).\npotential linkages between depth-dependent changes in substrates and microbial community composition are evident from recent mesopelagic studies. pronounced mesopelagic physico-chemical gradients influence particle-attached microbes and are linked to changes in the composition and function of microbes in the mesopelagic51,52. others have shown that microscale community ecology of particle-attached bacteria can partially control carbon turnover rates53,54. bacterial community structure and function (and hence bges) may also be influenced by depth-dependent changes in particle characteristics, including sinking rates and surface area:volume ratios driven by mesopelagic particle fragmentation55. fragmentation has been linked to the concept of microbial gardening by microzooplankton56 and mesozooplankton57 with the exposure of fragmented \u2018fresh\u2019 surfaces enabling microbial colonization and potential changes to mr (fig. 4d). in the absence of a dominant driver such as temperature, at higher-latitude sites (fig. 3b), we suggest that the most likely additional processes to influence increases in cremin are microbial community structure and function and their interplay with substrates, and potentially the small changes in temperature.\nrelationships between cremin and depth or temperature were assessed via a linear model fit (fig. 3). considering the large range of dissolved oxygen concentrations observed at ben (about 45\u2013220 \u00b5mol kg\u22121) and the potential role of oxygen in controlling cremin (refs. 11,84), the relationship between cremin and dissolved oxygen concentration was also assessed. at ben, a lower correlation was obtained between",

        "context": "methods for calculation of effect sizes). observed shifts in si:nexport were surprisingly consistent across the different biomes with variable contributions of diatoms to overall plankton biomass, as indicated by the range of baseline si:n ratios (<0.1 in svalbard to approximately 1.8 in sweden; fig. 1b).\nnotably, the influence of oa on si:n was only detectable for sinking particles (collected in sediment traps), but not for particulate matter suspended in the water column (fig. 1c). this suggests that the observed oa effects on si:n emerged primarily while the biogenic detrital particles were sinking and not due to biotic effects during their production (see methods). most probably, lower ph decelerated the dissolution of sinking opal and thereby increased si:nexport. seawater is generally undersaturated in silicic acid and thus corrosive to the amorphous silica of diatom shells16. thus, diatoms protect their cell wall silica against chemical dissolution with an organic coating surrounding the cell17. once this protective coating is degraded by bacteria (with the onset of senescence), dissolution rates of diatom silica increase drastically18. this usually coincides with the termination of diatom blooms and sinking of this biomass (for example, as marine snow). this mechanism explains why an oa effect on opal dissolution in our mesocosm data only becomes apparent in sinking material but not in suspended particulate matter. this interpretation is supported by both theory and empirical studies, which have demonstrated that chemical dissolution rates of biogenic silica are reduced at lower ph17,19,20. the observed oa effect in our experiments was a 17% increase in si:nexport for a ph decrease of around 0.3. assuming that this was\nthis mechanism can also explain why such an effect of oa on si:nexport has not been observed before, as few experimental studies have the capacity to differentiate between suspended and sinking material (that is, production and degradation of sinking particles). furthermore, opal dissolution kinetics are probably also the reason why finland is the only study site where no oa effect on si:n was detected (fig. 1): because salinity is another relevant factor controlling rates of chemical opal dissolution\u2014higher salinity enhances dissolution rates19,23\u2014the low salinity of approximately 6 psu (practical salt units) in finland probably obscured any potential influence of oa. it should be noted that response patterns of si:c were more variable than those detected for si:n, owing to additional and variable shifts in c:n under oa (extended data fig. 2).\npossible other contributing factors to oa impacts on si:n although our results provide strong evidence for a chemical effect of decreasing ph on opal dissolution, additional or alternative explanations for the observed oa impacts on si:n in the mesocosm studies cannot be fully excluded. on the basis of previous findings, one would expect that oa impacts on si:nexport can be explained by responses of diatoms. from a physiological perspective, lower ph may theoretically facilitate silicification by diatoms. the solubility of si in seawater decreases with decreasing ph, promoting precipitation and inhibiting dissolution of opal. diatoms are known to utilize this physicochemical property to precipitate opal in a cellular compartment with low ph conditions47,48. however, experimental evidence is scarce and partly controversial, with indications for either enhanced or reduced silica production under lower ph49,50. from an ecological perspective, higher si:nexport may have arisen from shifts in phytoplankton community composition, with a greater proportion of particle export driven by diatoms compared to other (non-silicifying) taxa, or by more heavily silicified species within the diatom community. however, our data do not support either of these two potential explanations, as the influence of oa on si:n is only detectable for vertical particle fluxes (collected in sediment traps), but not for freshly produced particulate matter in the water column (fig. 1c). this suggests that oa effects on si:n emerged primarily while the biogenic detrital particles were sinking and not due to biotic effects during their production. another possibility is that changes in n remineralization under simulated oa additionally contributed to the increase in si:n. however, the current consensus is that bacterial communities and organic matter remineralization are mostly resilient to oa51. results from studies that reported effects are very variable and, in most cases, it was not possible to separate direct ph effects (for example, on bacterial activity) from indirect effects mediated through ph-driven changes in quality and/or quantity of the organic matter substrate. thus, there are currently no indications that oa will enhance n consumption of sinking organic matter. altogether, the various independent lines of empirical evidence (mesocosms, ocean sediment traps, chemical studies) and the consistency of their results suggest that the ph effect on si dissolution is the most probable explanation for our findings.\nnote that some experiments covered larger pco2 ranges than considered in the analysis of oa effect sizes in fig. 1, because we have limited the \u2018future oa\u2019 scenario to pco2 levels between ~700 to 1,000 \u03bcatm (see methods). we note that the ambient treatment comprises mesocosms without co2 perturbation, and in cases of gradient setups, those with a co2 elevated by a maximum of 100 \u03bcatm relative to ambient. specified pco2 values represent the average over the respective study period. if possible, the analysis of si:nexport comprised the entire experimental duration. however, some time periods had to be excluded from this analysis, if temporal dynamics of plankton succession and particle export did not allow for an accurate analysis of pco2 effects. this was the case when (1) the sedimentation of a preceding plankton bloom had not reached the sediment traps or was still ongoing at the end of the study (svalbard after day 22, gran canaria after day 25), or (2) export flux originated from biomass produced during the initial experimental period, before pco2 manipulation was completed (finland

        "context": "methods for calculation of effect sizes). observed shifts in si:nexport were surprisingly consistent across the different biomes with variable contributions of diatoms to overall plankton biomass, as indicated by the range of baseline si:n ratios (<0.1 in svalbard to approximately 1.8 in sweden; fig. 1b).\nnotably, the influence of oa on si:n was only detectable for sinking particles (collected in sediment traps), but not for particulate matter suspended in the water column (fig. 1c). this suggests that the observed oa effects on si:n emerged primarily while the biogenic detrital particles were sinking and not due to biotic effects during their production (see methods). most probably, lower ph decelerated the dissolution of sinking opal and thereby increased si:nexport. seawater is generally undersaturated in silicic acid and thus corrosive to the amorphous silica of diatom shells16. thus, diatoms protect their cell wall silica against chemical dissolution with an organic coating surrounding the cell17. once this protective coating is degraded by bacteria (with the onset of senescence), dissolution rates of diatom silica increase drastically18. this usually coincides with the termination of diatom blooms and sinking of this biomass (for example, as marine snow). this mechanism explains why an oa effect on opal dissolution in our mesocosm data only becomes apparent in sinking material but not in suspended particulate matter. this interpretation is supported by both theory and empirical studies, which have demonstrated that chemical dissolution rates of biogenic silica are reduced at lower ph17,19,20. the observed oa effect in our experiments was a 17% increase in si:nexport for a ph decrease of around 0.3. assuming that this was\nthis mechanism can also explain why such an effect of oa on si:nexport has not been observed before, as few experimental studies have the capacity to differentiate between suspended and sinking material (that is, production and degradation of sinking particles). furthermore, opal dissolution kinetics are probably also the reason why finland is the only study site where no oa effect on si:n was detected (fig. 1): because salinity is another relevant factor controlling rates of chemical opal dissolution\u2014higher salinity enhances dissolution rates19,23\u2014the low salinity of approximately 6 psu (practical salt units) in finland probably obscured any potential influence of oa. it should be noted that response patterns of si:c were more variable than those detected for si:n, owing to additional and variable shifts in c:n under oa (extended data fig. 2).\npossible other contributing factors to oa impacts on si:n although our results provide strong evidence for a chemical effect of decreasing ph on opal dissolution, additional or alternative explanations for the observed oa impacts on si:n in the mesocosm studies cannot be fully excluded. on the basis of previous findings, one would expect that oa impacts on si:nexport can be explained by responses of diatoms. from a physiological perspective, lower ph may theoretically facilitate silicification by diatoms. the solubility of si in seawater decreases with decreasing ph, promoting precipitation and inhibiting dissolution of opal. diatoms are known to utilize this physicochemical property to precipitate opal in a cellular compartment with low ph conditions47,48. however, experimental evidence is scarce and partly controversial, with indications for either enhanced or reduced silica production under lower ph49,50. from an ecological perspective, higher si:nexport may have arisen from shifts in phytoplankton community composition, with a greater proportion of particle export driven by diatoms compared to other (non-silicifying) taxa, or by more heavily silicified species within the diatom community. however, our data do not support either of these two potential explanations, as the influence of oa on si:n is only detectable for vertical particle fluxes (collected in sediment traps), but not for freshly produced particulate matter in the water column (fig. 1c). this suggests that oa effects on si:n emerged primarily while the biogenic detrital particles were sinking and not due to biotic effects during their production. another possibility is that changes in n remineralization under simulated oa additionally contributed to the increase in si:n. however, the current consensus is that bacterial communities and organic matter remineralization are mostly resilient to oa51. results from studies that reported effects are very variable and, in most cases, it was not possible to separate direct ph effects (for example, on bacterial activity) from indirect effects mediated through ph-driven changes in quality and/or quantity of the organic matter substrate. thus, there are currently no indications that oa will enhance n consumption of sinking organic matter. altogether, the various independent lines of empirical evidence (mesocosms, ocean sediment traps, chemical studies) and the consistency of their results suggest that the ph effect on si dissolution is the most probable explanation for our findings.\nnote that some experiments covered larger pco2 ranges than considered in the analysis of oa effect sizes in fig. 1, because we have limited the \u2018future oa\u2019 scenario to pco2 levels between ~700 to 1,000 \u03bcatm (see methods). we note that the ambient treatment comprises mesocosms without co2 perturbation, and in cases of gradient setups, those with a co2 elevated by a maximum of 100 \u03bcatm relative to ambient. specified pco2 values represent the average over the respective study period. if possible, the analysis of si:nexport comprised the entire experimental duration. however, some time periods had to be excluded from this analysis, if temporal dynamics of plankton succession and particle export did not allow for an accurate analysis of pco2 effects. this was the case when (1) the sedimentation of a preceding plankton bloom had not reached the sediment traps or was still ongoing at the end of the study (svalbard after day 22, gran canaria after day 25), or (2) export flux originated from biomass produced during the initial experimental period, before pco2 manipulation was completed (finland

this has been suggested to affect foraminiferal physiology in past warm events35, is evident today in coral symbionts36 and would increase the vulnerability of the group.\nthe pre-industrial experiment adopts a similar grid and carbon-cycle configuration to that described previously64. the model is spun up under the pre-industrial state (1765) for 10,000 years, with an atmospheric co2 concentration of 278 ppm and a dust field from a previous report65. we next use the historical co2 data as input to force the model to run from the pre-industrial age to the present day (2022)48, and impose a series of idealized future co2 forcings causing 1.5 \u00b0c, 2 \u00b0c, 3 \u00b0c and 4 \u00b0c global air warming, with all the other parameterization the same as for the pre-industrial simulation (supplementary fig. 2). for simplicity, we do not include any other greenhouse gases in this study.\nthe historical global mean surface temperature aligns well with the hadcrut5 dataset66, and the global mean sst agrees with the ersst v.5 dataset48 (supplementary fig. 2). the future experiment results are comparable with fully coupled cmip earth system models. the model predicts the same subtropical and tropical zooplankton biomass loss and polar biomass increment as cmip6 models67. the npp is projected to decline between 1% (1 \u00b0c) and 10% (4 \u00b0c) by 2100 relative to the present day, like the cmip5 average and the lower bound of cmip6 (ref. 67) (supplementary fig. 3).",
